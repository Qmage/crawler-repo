Kuala Lumpur,Lingkaran Syed Putra,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,Malaysia,"Stayed there for 3 days while attending a meeting in the same complex. The check in was smooth and professional. Room, a one-bedroom apartment, was really nice. The bedroom was huge, with 2 wardrobes, so that 2 people could each have their own wardrobe. The bed was really comfortable, and there was even a couch in the bedroom. Bathroom was spacious too, with the toilet separate from the shower and bath - a nice touch which I always like.The living room had couch and 2 armchairs and long coffee table. A writing desk was in the corner. Huge TV. Kitchenette fully equipped, with counter and bar stool.It was perfect. Made it home away from home for me.Sure some of the wood surfaces showed some wearing, but that is to be expected - at least it's real wood, that's why it wears, not plastic.",2016/10/08 13:11:40,2016-10-06,Great Apartment Hotel,59200,ReginaldSLin,5,"Singapore, Singapore"

Kuala Lumpur,Lingkaran Syed Putra,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,Malaysia,"We stayed overnight for an event nearby the hotel. Check in process was smooth and breezy, the lobby is huge. Concierge guy being helpful with our luggage. Love the room, decent size for the price. And they have rain shower along with bath tub! We ordered in-room dining at 11.30pm, the girl over the phone said the food will be ready in 40 mnts. But surprisingly it came knocking on our door after 15 mnts! The nasi goreng kampung was delicious but mee goreng mamak is a turn down. We had our breakfast pretty late (10.15am) and they already started packing stuff and not refilling the drinks and some food already finished. Nevertheless, the spread was amazing, delicious and great. I love the people at the egg counter and roti canai counter. Very attentive and helpful.

Kuala Lumpur,Lingkaran Syed Putra,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,Malaysia,"Was staying in this hotel from 20 Sept to 23 September and got room 916. Was in KL on business and discussion so most of the time we were based at the lobby bar near the hotel reception. It was a convenient location to meet and the atmosphere is conducive for the discussion that we were having. Staff was attentive but severe shortage of manpower. There was only one service staff on duty and he was handling everything. I love the room especially the bathroom. This is the first time I encountered a rain shower,a bath tub and a hand shower in one bath room. The bath room layout was great, it segregated the toilet from the shower. There is a toilet room and a shower room and you have draw out drawers for hair dryer and to put towels. Bath room accessories are elegant and really user friendly. It a really well thought out and designed for the traveller toilet especially for the female traveller. Well the hotel have link bridge is connected to the garden mall and the garden mall has link bridges on the basement, 2nd and 3rd floor to megamall. A lot of restaurants on the basement level and you have 2 anchor tenants Aeon and metro with many other shops on all the 4 levels. The sports equipment and accessories shops are all located on the highest level and you even has a cinema with 21 screens! Couldnt ask for more. Too bad we only has time after work to explore the area. We didn't even need to venture out during the 2.5 days that we were there. Great place to stay, shop and relax By the way the gym is huge, too bad I don't have time to use it.",2016/10/08 13:11:40,2016-09-24,Comfortable stay with great personal touch,59200,Sailortraveller,4,"Singapore, Singapore"

I had some serious arthritic back problems addressed while on business and staying at the hotel. A bandage leaked and blood stained my sheets. Sabrina realized and saw that I was unable to walk.. She immediately made up my room, helped me, got me water, advised me that she would be working on the floor and that I should call if I needed help. Sabrina notified her manager, Marina who soon visited me, saw that I could barely get out of bed due to back & hip pain. She asked what she could do to help and brought in Suzana . Margaret also was notified and visited. As a traveler for over 20 years, there is nothing worse than being sick on the road. This team supported me, provided meals, water and a late check out. I am thankful for their services and will tell this story, praise and promote this hotel. There is no other place to stay in Kuala Lumpur..

Kuala Lumpur,Lingkaran Syed Putra,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,Malaysia,"Booked a deluxe room at the hotel via their website and it was seriously good valued for money. Corporate photos looked luxurious but I was somewhat skeptical based on the price. It turned out I was right. It wasn't as luxurious as what you see on their website.So pay for what you get. With that in mind, one would get good value for a stay here. The room was clean, modern but somewhat basic (eg no hot water kettle for coffee). The state of the room was excellent except for the bathtub. Everything looked renovated but the bathtub. Strange omission.The establishment could be classified as a family or budget business hotel. It was not within international hotel chain standards. But that would cost at least 1.5-2x more. The lobby was basis. There was a lounge available for business. But you could got to the malls for alternatives. On malls, this hotel was connected to a high end and mass market malls.

Check-in was a breeze at 6pm, with the process done in a couple of minutes. Since the hotel is connected to a big mall, dinner choices are practically meters away from the hotel. (The best part is you need not worry about having a little too much to drink because, worst case, you can crawl your way back.)The deluxe room I occupied had the following basic and special features: large LCD TV, king-sized bed, plenty of pillows, walk-in closet inside the toilet and bath, and nice view of the city. Furnishings were alright. Very convenient place. Room cleanliness can be improved though as I noticed a small piece of trash, cotton buds and dirt by one side of the room near the curtains. The breakfast buffet provides a wide selection of food items which can surely help kickstart your day. Plenty of positive points at The Garden.
