Kuala Lumpur,Toilet Leaking ... Front Desk Misleading,Wong2080,"Penang Island, Malaysia",2016/10/08 22:16:45,59200,Cititel Mid Valley Lingkaran Syed Putra,2016-10-06,Malaysia,"Stayed 4 nites in August 2016 :Three Complaints : 1. Shower Cubicle water leaking into Toilet floor : Water seeps up from beneath the floor tiles and flood the entire toilet floor after each shower. This shows that House Keeping did not check + wash the Shower area, as they would have seen the leaks if they had washed the shower daily. 2. Misleading Car Parking Info given by Front Desk : 1st Staff told me there is ONLY ONE Complimentary car bay allocated for hotel guests and it is always taken, hence i parked at the Mall and paid RM5 per entry basis to avoid wasting time hoping for that One Bay. 2nd Staff told me we can park in any of the many Complimentary bays within the hotel parking section 3rd Staff told me to just insert my Parking Ticket into the Exit Arm Reader without informing me that i have to first Validate my ticket into the Auto Park Machine hidden away at the Basement Lift Lobby Corner, resulting in me stucked at the Exit Reader. Can you please have a consistent SOP on Parking to stop all confusions to your Guests, you can put all these Info on a Note for Guests Parking inside the Rooms and also pass one to the Guests upon their Enquiries on Parking at the Front Desk. 3. Hotel Feedback via Email : There is a Note in the Room requesting for Guests Feedback via Email. Upon checkout, nobody requested for my Email to send the Feedback Form to me. This speaks volume on your Hotel S.O.PAs there is no Feedback Form given upon checkout, this is the only way to inform you.",3,Cititel Mid Valley

If you want to shop in Mid Valley and (or) The Gardens area, this hotel is the best way to save your shopping money. The room is so small for its class. Be careful to stay here if you are fat, the shower room maybe is not enough for you since it is really really small.

The furnishing looks old and outdated. The stand up shower is small with no space to maneuver. The hot water wasn't working properly. The shower is not very clean either. The only advantage is their location. The hotel is attached to a mall with great shops. The mall has restaurants that served varieties of food. I will not return to stay in this hotel.,3,Cititel Mid Valley

The Gardens Mall is right next door for your more high end shops. Saves heaps of time waiting for cabs/catching trains if you're in KL for just a quick shopping spree (theres also a massage place in the lobby if you've got sore feet after a full day of wandering around the mall).Rooms are tiny (barely had enough space to move around with 2 suitcases in the room) but it's a good option if you're after super cheap, clean and well located accomodation. The staff are very friendly as well.Not too far from KLIA either - about 1 hour in light traffic.",4,Cititel Mid Valley

No queues at those hours.My cousin came to pass me something on Saturday evening so I thought I can let them use the complimentary parking indicated on the check-in booklet, Even though my cousin and her husband speak Bahasa Melayu, they don't quite understand how does the complimentary parking work and didn't manage to enjoy the parking benefits. Room is ok and staff are warm and courteous.Forgot to inform the hotel about the faulty safe in the room (2707) when checking out. It showed ""Error"" when we tried to lock the safe. The time in the lifts gave us a few scare but guess no one really check the time in the lifts anyway.The hotel used to include steamed mini rice noodle roll in the breakfast spread. According to the staff at the egg counter, the hotel no longer serve that for breakfast. My sister recommended this hotel to me in part because she likes their breakfast, especially the mini rice noodle roll, croissants and kaya. Guess she will be sad to know that the mini rice noodle roll is no longer available. But the croissants and kaya are still around.",4,Cititel Mid Valley

It began with the reception staff (Fhairul if I'm not mistaken) patiently entertaining my requests during check-in. Another reception staff was happily to show and company me to the mall and restaurants nearby. Housekeeping staff were very tolerate and helpful allowing my 1 year old son to play along the aisleway during her cleaning job. Don't forget, she also helped to carry our bags when we checking out. Restaurants staff were very warm and sensitive to provide the babychair once we entered the restaurants. They even offered to bring us foods and drinks while we were occupied with our son.

So many great restaurants and shops in Mid Valley Megamall underneath. Our deluxe room was tidy and spacious. Air conditioner and ceiling fan can be adjusted for the perfect temperature. Service for check-in and check-out was fast and friendly. Only small drawbacks - very limited TV channels (not much kids' TV at all). And I fully support the environmental consciousness sign about not needing new towels every day - yet when I hung up my towels as suggested, and the room was serviced, they replaced the towels! We don't need new towels every day so we just started putting the Do Not Disturb sign up. It would be great if the cleaning staff followed the instructions on the green sign the hotel has put in the bathrooms. A great place to stay though, good value!

Had full range of food choices, and shopping including cinemas.In general, the hotel is quite ok except that the rooms were quite small. There are no additional space for additional beds and big luggages. Toilet is also small with no bathtubs. My room had a view of Petronas Twin Tower though. TV was also quite small and did not have much channels to choose from. Room service staffs were nice as they left a personal handwritten note to let them know if you require anything to make your stay more comfortable.

Their last stay at the Concorde taught them it wasn't worth the dollars spent. We thought being located in the Mid Valley would be a breeze to access shopping and dining daily. Checking in was not that welcoming with the front office staff flatly turning down my request for a room upgrade even though the hotel was not full. He however compromised on arranging connecting rooms so it was convenient for our family's daily gathering. Unfortunately, the rooms on the 20th floor were old and in need of renovation. The aircon in our room wasn't working and despite being fixed the next day, never really functioned properly the rest of the week. The rooms had no bath tubs and it proved difficult for our son's daily bath. Surprisingly, housekeeping supplied an old plastic baby bath tub as an alternative. As it looked rather worn out like most of the hotel's facilities, we had to scrub it daily with Dettol. Breakfast buffet was an additional charge and was of poor value. There were no fresh oranges, so we had to buy our own from the supermarket in the Mall. The buffet's fruit juices were all sugary and coloured, sausages were very salty and local choices were curries, porridge and noodles, all done at low quality. Only consolations were the omelette and sunny side up fried eggs. Our son's daily breakfast was restricted to eggs and we freshly squeezed our own orange juice. On several days, it was not just hazy outside but also in the hotel lobby. The smoke was traced to the Dragon-i outlet next to the lobby. This outlet used to be our favorite but our dining experience here this week confirmed the present lower standards of its very salty and oily dishes. You have to be watchful of strangers lingering around and taking the lifts especially when with a young child. The hotel houses one of the few ""legal"" spa brothels in the city on the 3rd floor which attracts a lot of footfall hot under the collar. This explains why the hotel carpark is usually full. On Friday evening, I had to wait in the queue for an hour unsuccessfully to park. Luckily, you can find alternative car parking in the Midvalley mall. Within walking distance, you can access department stores Aeon, Isetan and Robinsons and restaurants Village Roast Duck,Han Room and Canton-i(closed for renovation).The mall also has very competitive foreign exchange booths for tourists.",1,Cititel Mid Valley

Good Value for Money is another motivating factor. Most impressive was the Hand Written Note that is kept for you by the housekeeping staff - this time with an Origami Swan too ..., (i will treasure it...,)This time i had a few and minor irritants. I had booked the room well in advance and had made two requests - one was a room overlooking the KLCC area and the other was an east headboard. I was granted one (View) but not the headboard. This was minor - they mentioned a sudden surge of bookings due to a corporate entity. However - i felt - given the booking was made 20 days in advance - they would have complied. Second was the non-delivery of the News Paper on sunday (8 AM morning - was told that the delivery had not happened yet). Again - nothing major - but i had requested the staff before leaving the room to arrange for the paper delivery - did not happen, did not want to pursue it any more.I was given a room at the end of the Hotel at the 21 floor, which had the soft din from the Air Cooling Towers constantly on (ok ., it was a low decibel sound ...., )Still - i am very happy with this Hotel and will continue to stay for future visits - will not complain about the Small Bathrooms - since they do have an extensive toiletry kit setup.",4,Cititel Mid Valley

If you can afford to pay 5-star rates, you will get to stay at 7-star hotels. That's how good the hotel's customer service is in KL. I am a Malaysian by birth but am now residing in the UK. Every time I go back ""home"" to KL, Cititel will be my first choice of hotel, due to its affordable rate, which corresponds with the facilities it provides for its guests. I often stay for 3 or 4 nights on each occasion and as such, do not wish to spend too much on accommodation alone.Another reason for my decision to stay at this hotel is its perfect location. Situated inside a shopping mall which carries most of the High Street brands, I do not have to step outside the building to do my shopping. It is also located near a train station (KTM) where you can take the train to majot Metro hub and conveniently from there get the metro trains to the Golden Triangle of KL (the downtown) and most parts of KL. Alternatively, taxis are aplenty. During my last stay, I have used both the Taxi apps Uber and My Taxi to get reliable taxis to ferry me around the city instead of using the notorious local taxis. During my last 6-night stay, I have chosen the Superior Room, which is the cheapest and smaller than the Deluxe. My room is as the photos advertised  not very spacious. After unlocking my large luggage and placing them opened on the floor, I only have just enough room to move around the bed (a double bed). It is reasonably clean and toiletries are provided, along with clean, fluffy towels.Well, you get what you pay for. In my opinion, Cititel is not the cheapest hotel in town. You can get much cheaper ones but the standard will be lower and the location not as central and convenient. This hotel is good enough for me as a base. It has free wifi which is fast from my room. It also has free parking at the basement for my rented car.Overall, I can highly recommend this hotel to others who just want an affordable base to rest their heads at night. If you want a more luxurious one, try their sister hotel called Boulevard at the other end of the shopping mall or the Gardens Hotel and suites across the road.",5,Cititel Mid Valley

Be aware the KTM is not like MRT that comes regularly at 2-5 mins interval, you could be waiting at the platform for up to 30 mins for the next train. So it might be better to take a taxi unless you are not hurry for time. We took a taxi to KLiA2 fromHotel at MYR80, quoted by a person waiting outside the hotel .

Let's start with the good things about this hotel before we go to the not-so-good things. The good part of this hotel is, it is attached to Mid Valley shopping centre. The hotel staff are generally courteous and very efficient. It was pleasant interacting with them. The bad things about this hotel are:1) It is cheap. As in it looks and feels and smells cheap. But hey, you get what you pay for so don't complain. I'm saying, if you're not a cheap person, don't stay here. 2) Security can potentially be a major problem in this hotel. The lifts do not require you to tab your room key to get to the desired floor. This means anyone (guests and non-guests) are free to wander around the hotel, including the corridor right outside your room. If you are a female traveller, you might want to take note of that and be extra careful when you stay here - or choose another hotel. 3) The bathrooms are not clean. Mould are starting to form in the shower area and it is positively disgusting. 4) The hotel management somehow decided to change the lift system so that only two lifts serve the lower floors (level 15 and below) while 5 lifts serve the upper floors (level 15 to 28). The result of that is that during morning peak period, we had to wait for 15 mins before we can get into a lift. I have never come across a hotel with such a stupid lift system (yes, even amongst budget hotels). That is unnecessary. I wouldn't want to stay here again and I wouldn't recommend it to my friends.

Although the room is small but is well equipped with everything. TV, air conditioner, even got ceiling fan! Safe deposit box, small fridge, electric kettle, personal stuff like toothbrush. 2 room cards were provided, great for family.Location: The best part of this hotel is its extremely convenient location which is just a few steps walk to Mid Valley Megamall, when i say a few steps, it's real! You also can access to the high splurge The Gardens Mall which is adjacent to the Mid Valley Megamall, what else you want? These 2 malls is full of shops for you to hanging around. Apart from that, the Mid Valley KTM Station is also within walking distance which you can travel around KL using KTM or LRT. Food / restaurant: Buffet breakfast is not complimentary, pls purchase the breakfast when you booked through the hotel website in order to get 50% discount, otherwise you will have to pay RM40++ per person over the counter. Many choices of food is available, from Asian to Western style.Services: Most of the hotel staff is friendly, helpful and courteous. Nothing to complain about. When i checked in, the receptionist took the initiative to offer me complimentary baby cot for my son which really help my wife and i to have a good sleep at night as we do not have to share the bed with our son. Great job! Complimentary newspapers is also provided everyday, nowadays many hotels do not offer things like this anymore.

Whether it's in lobby, inside the elevator or on the corridor, i can hardly feel the coldness, or actually no air cond at all.

I emailed the hotel and the communications manager quickly responded advising they would look into it. Shortly after the head of housekeeping emailed stating that they had the items.

We travelled with children and old folks, and upon checking in, we were told by the front desk that there are no more connecting rooms. We travelled in family and had planned for the two kids to stay in one twin room connecting to a double room with their parents. I needed only 1 connecting room and told the front desk staff the reason. But he just flatly tell me there are no more connecting rooms unless we want smoking floor. I have already told him I am travelling with old folks and children, and he is asking the kids to stay in smoking room? His suggestion is totally insensitive. Besides that, he is showing me a uninterested and impatient expression. I am the one now stuck in the situation, I wasn't even showing him any attitude as I know it was not his problem. But the least he could have done was to give me a more suitable suggestion, instead of just telling me ""WE ARE FULLY BOOKED TODAY""It was not a pleasant checking-in experience as we had to make necessary re-shuffling of pairing for each room. However, the House-keeping lady (Milus) totally made up to the unpleasant start of our stay. On day two, when we came back from shopping, the rooms were nicely made up, and we even received a small paper origami bird. My baby loved playing with it. And that is not all, when come day 3, we requested for late checkout till 1pm as I had to go get lunch for my baby. When we returned at 12.30pm, the room key had already been deactivated. My husband went back down to the reception to reactivate the keys again. As it was near the check out time, I squatted outside my room door to feed my baby as I was afraid I'll exceed the checkout time should I wait till my husband come back with the revalidated keys. The House-keeping lady (not sure if she's Milus as i forgotten to look at her nametag) saw me squatting outside my door feeding my baby, and offered to let me into the room with her key. I was so grateful! And luckily for her kind gesture, we managed to check out on time. The key that my husband went to re-validate is still not working after the revalidation by the reception counter. Imagine he would have to go down again the 2nd time if not for the kindness of the House-keeping lady. Room is small but comfortable. Free WIFI is provided but the connection is super lousy.As for breakfast, the food range is acceptable. There's the usual bread counter with freshly baked croissant, cooked food station with not much variety, soup noodle is good, Egg station but their soft boil eggs tray were always empty. My room package comes with Breakfast, but if you were to walk-in, it would cost RM45 per adult. And honestly I would not pay that kind of price for such food range.

The reception found very friendly during check in, explained to you the hotel facilities with the smile even through you are repeated guest.Beside, the bell approached you to check whether you need any assistance on your luggage, a little touch, hence this created a ""WOW"" to the guest.Wifi in the room was more stable now compared to the previous time.A slight make over in the room, the TV, TV channels and amenities has improved. Best thing was the little hand writing note from the room maid, asking you if you need any other thing or service, you may just contact the names below.

The hotel is clean, quite and with very helpful staff nothing is to much bother. The room was as you would expect for the price range yet it had everything you needed. The view from the 27th floor was stunning. Breakfast was reasonable open from very early till 10.30, if you like it quite then don't go early around 9 is a good time. As the shopping centre is next door it was so easy to look round and take your purchased items back to your room and then shop some more or do as I did let the family shop and I sat in the cafe. Hotel staff fantastic all helpful if I had to choose I could not. Would I stay again, yes with out doubt was there a down side yes a few more coffee and tea in the room would have been good but if that's it this Cititel is well worth a visit as it good location for airport shopping and sightseeing",4,Cititel Mid Valley
Kuala Lumpur,A great place to stay,Remlig,Western Australia,2016/10/08 22:17:25,59200,Cititel Mid Valley Lingkaran Syed Putra,2015-07-03,Malaysia,"Previously when visiting Kuala Lumpur my wife and I have stayed out at xxxxx. We usually try to avoid being too close to the city center and try to find a hotel that offers close access to the local rail system. I went for a change of scenery this time and looked for accommodation in Mid Valley. I found Cititel Hotel with a train station virtually across the road.  I scored brownie points when I told my wife that it was part of a complex that had 2 massive shopping Malls. At our prior lodging there was only a small mall for her to explore of an evening.  I have to be honest, I also lost 1 or 2 points when we discovered that the hotel didnt have a swimming pool a day later. I guess you win some lose some. Cititel is a multi-story hotel . We managed to get a room on the 12th floor, which is about mid tower. Our view included the Petronas Twin Towers and the Menara KL tower in the distance. The bed was massive and the room tastefully furnished. The bathroom was a little cramped. There was no noise intruding from other rooms or from the road below. We were fairly close to the lift which is good for us and surprisingly there was no noise emanating from the operating lift as is some time the case. The hotel is certainly not brand new but it has been very well maintained. The foyer is spacious and well lighted. The staff are efficient and very friendly. There are plenty of taxis available in the area. The malls have literally dozens and dozens of cafes and restaurants catering for all tastes, to choose from. It is certainly a great place to stay",4,Cititel Mid Valley

You can be spoilt for choice in terms of food too; you have a choice of not too expensive food like 'yong tou fu' and porridge; if you feel you can afford to splurge then try the Coliseum or Dragon I. I had dinner at Dragon I, a little bit pricey but I love the spinach with century egg soup. Good service and friendly waiters.The hotel room is comfy but the free coffee tastes awful. I must mention the wide spread of complimentary breakfast. I really enjoyed the food and good coffee (much much better than the one in the room!).I had problem with the toilet flush but one phone call and the maintenance man was there to rectify it. Really appreciate the efficiency.A point worth noting is that shampoo is not provided. I had assumed all hotels provide such a basic necessity. Anyway buying a bottle of shampoo is no hassle as there are 2 hypermarkets in midvalley.I would stay here again if I want easy access to countless shops and eateries not only in midvalley but to other parts of Kuala Lumpur.",3,Cititel Mid Valley

If you need space - go downstairs. Cleanliness was so so. There is this old smell - the smell of fatigue in the room. It is an old hotel - close to 20 years.Downside of this hotel? Yes - firstly parking is an absolute nightmare. The shopping centre is so damn crowded that its a chore just to drive in - traffic everywhere. I went on a Saturday and it took us a good 30 min just to get into the car park and another 30 to find a lot.

I had originally booked my room for about two weeks, but then I kept on extending and extending my stay. On two previous occasions, having extended my stay and paid the bills and re-validated my keys the night BEFORE my checkout date, a man from the Concierge STILL came to my door at 12 noon (checkout time) and banged on it a couple of times. I was in the shower and was unable to react in time. The man then tried to open my door EVEN THOUGH THE DO NOT DISTURB sign was hanging from the door knob. He left when he did not get a response from me. When I got out of the shower, I complained to the Reception and they apologized for the ""confusion"". Three weeks later, EXACTLY the same thing happened. I had been due to check out on that day BUT HAD EXTENDED MY STAY TWO DAYS BEFORE THAT CHECK OUT DATE AND HAD RE-VALIDATED MY KEYS AND HAD BEEN GIVEN A NEW DATE OF DEPARTURE BY THE RECEPTION THE NIGHT BEFORE MY CHECKOUT DATE. Yet, there was the man again, banging on my door at 12 pm, and AGAIN, he tried to open my door despite the DO NOT DISTURB sign on it but he couldn't open it cause the latch was on. Again, I made a complaint to Reception. And today, this awful hotel's ridiculously incompetent staff did exactly the same thing YET AGAIN. I was fast asleep, with the DO NOT DISTURB sign on my door, and STILL, a man from the Concierge comes BANGING on my door, waking me up and you can imagine how I felt. I grabbed my mobile phone, opened my door, showed this incompetent and aggressive member of staff my key card containing the NEW DEPARTURE DATE, which was NINE DAYS AHEAD, and yet he kept making excuses. Everything is on video. I closed the door after about 10 minutes of listening to this man's excuses and phoned the Reception and demanded to speak to the General Manager. The lady on the phone told me that he was in a meeting and she put me through to me the Duty Manager. He said he would investigate this matter and phoned me back 45 minutes later and told me that there had been a ""miscommunication"" between different departments of the Hotel and as a result the aggressive man from the Concierge came to my room believing that I was due to check out today. But here's the rub. My check-out date was YESTERDAY, not TODAY, so there was NO reason for ANYONE to have come banging on my door TODAY. And I still have not been able to speak to the General Manager about this. I believe that staff at this hotel are deliberately preventing me from speaking to him. If you value a good night' sleep, if you want hotel staff to be competent and keep proper records, and if you want hotel staff to HONOR THE DO NOT DISTURB SIGN THAT YOU'VE PLACED ON YOUR DOOR, the DO NOT come to Cititel Mid Valley Hotel in Kuala Lumpur. The staff at the hotel are the WORST that I have ever come across. They are incompetent, aggressive, make excuses for their mistakes and then cover everything up by not letting the guest complain to the General Manager. AVOID THIS HOTEL AT ALL COSTS.(However, I have to qualify my comments by saying that the Housekeeping staff are friendly and do a good job. It's the Reception and Concierge staff who are the worst I have ever come across).",1,Cititel Mid Valley

Kuala Lumpur,Convenient Location,lynnnnnnette,"Singapore, Singapore",2016/10/08 22:17:33,59200,Cititel Mid Valley Lingkaran Syed Putra,2015-04-14,Malaysia,"Mainly went around MidValley Shopping Centre during my stay in KL as I was there to attend an exhibition over the weekend. The hotel being next to the shopping mall was great as I didn't have much time other than after exhibition hours to do some shopping. Had booked into the Deluxe Room category - which was nice and very spacious. The service was also good. Met a lady from housekeeping on the way down to breakfast and requested for additional pillows which were promptly delivered to the room. The Housekeeping team also adds a nice personal touch with a handwritten note accompanied with a folded origami after the first night on how you may reach them for any requests.Food wise at the breakfast selection was plentiful in choices. Had not realised until the next day that there were a few stations outside on the terrace where there was a egg station, noodles station etc. Coffee and Tea is also not next to where you find the juices and feel that the flow of the breakfast buffet can be improved.",3,Cititel Mid Valley

The deluxe room I got was adequate in terms of space and comfortable queen-sized bed, complementary coffee/tea and a mini-fridge. Cleanliness was satisfactory though I think there was plenty of room for improvement. Noise from the A/C might be on the high side for some - even on lowest fan speed settings. Still, I managed to get some good night's sleep except for my last night there (a Friday) with some minor disturbances going on for a bit coming from the hallway. Buffet breakfast was offered with some variety, just enough to get the day going. The biggest advantage here is of course its connectivity to Mid Valley Mega Mall, which kept me pretty occupied with food and entertainment options - that's a huge plus.

At 1515, re-check with him. 2 rooms were ready while another 2 not yet. He should've told if not the same floor is ok or not. He just said nothing about this. Late for 1 hour plus still ignore the possible solution. At the end, Kalai was the one who settled this.2) Credit card charge amount issue- My teacher booked 2 months ago via online and paid half of the money for function room via debit card (cash transfer). Confirmation page also captured but transaction failed without any notice so far until we found out on the spot when Ahmad arranged the checkin. I gave him own credit card to charge on the spot. He straight away charge and without highlighting there was a problem on charging amount. Until next day when I checked out and was told, the amount was not fully charged and charged the remaining. Fahril kept on apologize and Ahmad not even care about telling what had happened he charged the wrong amount. Good to have Ahmad's colleague to bear the blame!3) Online reservation- If your online reservation unable to cater with your current system update, don't implement it. Debit card / Credit card charge in advance for booking fail without any notification via email or even a single phone call.Informed your receptionist Ahmad for his memorable service and attitude.

Midvalley has everything so you doesn't need to worry much! just a few steps and you're already at one of the largest shopping heaven in KL. the minus part is that : be aware that the KTM station needs you to walk up the stairs because the lift is always out of service so it's really troublesome if you're the type that don't travel light and with childrens. do take the cab as the cab will drop u off directly in front of the hotel lobby instead. The room that i stay is quite small so i basically have to put my luggage in the closet so that i have rooms to walk. I didn't opt for breakfast as i wanted to try all the shops outside of Midvalley. Basic amenities are provided, such as hairdryer, toiletries. they only give you one pillow each so im not sure if they charge if you requested extra pillow. For those that travel with families, do opt for bigger room and non smoking floor. they have fan in the room so it's a good option for those who can't stand sleeping in air conditioned room. The fan switch need to be changed though, it is so hard to adjust the speed, a lil twist to the right makes it go sooo fast and a lil twist again make it almost stop. oh! the housekeeper left a welcoming note and origami, which is very heartwarming, it shows they get to know their guest first :) Other than that, nothing much i can complaint. do bear in mind that they charge about Rm250 per night, so if you're not the type that wanted to spend too much on hotel, they are a lot of budget but still good hotel arounds Bukit Bintang area. just that this time around, i avoid that area due to the ugrading work of the public transport and traffic congestions.",4,Cititel Mid Valley

Kuala Lumpur,Looks good on the outside but delve a little deeper and you'll find the ugly truth,FoodieMan2013,"Penang Island, Malaysia",2016/10/08 22:17:42,59200,Cititel Mid Valley Lingkaran Syed Putra,2014-11-11,Malaysia,"Having only the advantage of being so closely located to Midvalley Megamall, this hotel has only its outlook to thank for. Oh where do I even begin?1) Receptionist- The first contact that every guest at every hotel meet is the receptionist. That is hwy it is important that the hotel takes every measure to hire helpful and friendly staff for its front desk. While checking in I wasn't met with any warm greetings or smiles. I was also put at a loss when I asked for directions around the place and was only met with a shrug and a reply of ""it's somewhere, I don't know"". Granted receptionists aren't meant to also play the role of a tour guide, but I think they should at least be able to give a good rough estimate at the very least.2)Room- When I entered my room, the air conditioning was already turned on and i found a piece of torn off cardboard jammed into the card slot by the wall where the sensors will pick up on the presence of a card in order to generate electricity for the room. I understand the purpose but I don't get the use of the torn scrap of cardboard. Does it cost that much for this hotel to spare another room card? The carpeting in the room is very old and rough, and it looks very dated. The room's lighting is also dim and gives the room an ambient lighting which some may feel is romantic but otherwise unnecessary. The bathroom is perhaps the worst feature of the room because it has absolutely NO HOT WATER. Pipes are always blasting out ice cold water whether it's in the morning or evening. There is also no shampoo available and what you get is some hand sanitizer that says ""shampoo"" on it but doesn't really get the job done.- BREAKFAST BUFFET IS THE WORST! Two words : Cold Food. Yup, the rice was cold, fish was cold, baked beans were cold, even the damn sausages were cold. Honestly, I don't get what the fuss is about with this hotel as it really feels like a complete rip-off. There are plenty of other hotels in the area so avoid this one unless you reall yhave no where else to go.",2,Cititel Mid Valley

The front desk officer is not the most friendly no matter how hard u smile to them. The hotel is not the safest because they don't have the requirement to scan your room card to get to your floor so anyone can simply go to your floor but the good thing is, the door has a lock that even with key, they can't get in. The room is very small but fully equip with iron, hair dryer, tv, boiler, cups, etc. The worst thing is the drain system that I have never experienced in any of the hotel in Asia. The water take forever to be cleared in the basin and just washing your hand, the water is brown, the water is extremely dirty. Went to Taiwan and China before, can't throw tissue in the bowl but usually in hotel, the drain system is better and u may throw. But in Cititel, once u throw, you have to flush 5 times to get rid of it. Mid valley shopping mall is just 3 mins walk away, very convenient and the mall is huge. Good to shop for 1-2 days. The breakfast has many variety and its fantastic. The waiters, waitress and managers are extremely friendly. Housekeeping is good, bed is comfortable but pillow has stains.

We were only there for a night and the room was clean, pleasant and quiet. The breakfast buffet in the morning was catered for a large population of travellers and we were able to indulge in both local cuisines and have western styled breakfast. Hotel staff were very friendly and approachable when we had questions regarding check out times and when we were in need for directions.

I have stayed at Cititel Mid Valley for my annual shopping trip since it first opened when I used to pay only RM98.00 nett per room. During the time, I have also seen it gone from good to bad and now, back to good! The newly renovated lobby and room is a refreshing change.Room amenities are good for a 3 star hotel; you get toothbrush, cotton bud and even slippers on top of the other usual amenities. Room size might be a bit small but is good enough since we only use it to sleep at night. Housekeeping does a decent job of cleaning up the room and changing the sheets daily. I also love the compact bathroom with humongous basin so that water doesn't splash all over the floor and a powerful shower head.However, I want to comment on the unfriendliness of some bellboys. One particular bellboy just stood there staring into space when my girlfriend and I were making our way to the hotel's main door as we alighted from our taxi with both our hands laden with shopping bags. He did not offer to open the glass door nor did he even smile to acknowledge us! To some, this might be a small incident but for me, it totally ruins the overall perception of the hotel. I understand that this is a busy hotel and that, some staff might be overworked but this is no excuse to be show your 'black' face to guests.On our last day, we requested for late check out as our flight was on 7:25pm but was greeted with a curt ' no, you have only until 1pm.' with no smile.

However I am very satisfied for this trip because what I have requested during my booking is fulfilled. May be I can add a little bit of something need to be improve is the staff at concierge may need to be more alert (maybe just coincidence), I was carrying many stuffs but he (standing outside - in-charge of transport) not even bother to open the door for me. But luckily the staffs inside has noticed and make their step forward faster so that can give me a hand and apologize. But that time I actually no need any assistant anymore.

As for the room itself, it is small, and not cleaned very well as I found someone's baby pacifier in the room. As for the breakfast, the choice of food is OK but the rice was left too long in the warmer that it became hard and not edible. The second day, the housekeeping named Pazli was very helpful when I left my room key and when I came back around few hours later, he even helped me again to open my room's door when he saw me struggling to open it as I was holding my baby and shopping bags. And, when we checked out, there was an incident where my husband forgot to pack his powerbank which was on the bed. After about 4 hours later, he remembered about the powerbank and we called the hotel to ask about the powerbank whereabout but the hotel just answered nothing were found in the room, obviously withiut any effort to ask the person in charge of cleaning the room when we checked out. When we called one more time, a manager named Margaret attended our case but she was not helpful and even asked us to make a complaint. I've written a proper complaint and am waiting for the answer. This hotel doesn't deserve good rating for the staffs. I once left my tablet at Parkcity Hotel Bintulu, Sarawak and when I called the hotel, the reception answered that there was nothing recorded in their lost and found system but they asked the housekeeping to check the room thoroughly, and guess what, they found the tablet! At that time, I was back in Miri (2 hours drive from Bintulu) and can only get the tablet in one week time, but the staffs were so honest that it was still safe and sound when I finally pick up the tablet. When I compared how Cititel handled our case to how Parkcity did it, it is obvious that Cititel just take the simplest way by saying nothing is found without any effort to help the guest.",2,Cititel Mid Valley

Here are my thoughts on fastest way to get to the hotel and the hotel as a whole: Transport to Hotel from KLIA and vice versa:1) if you are flying into KLIA, the best way to get to the hotel is by taking the KTM Express Railway, a 28 mins ride up to Sentral Station for rm35. Then from there, take the budget taxi for rm12 ( buy a taxi coupon from the counter there) to get to the hotel. If you arrive in the evenings, no taxi wants to move during the after work hour. ( heavy traffic jam) You will see many taxis queuing there in line but not moving and many people lining up queuing for taxis. Just ask any of the immobile taxis if they want to go to the hotel, some may ask for rm20 , so you top up another rm8 . It is better than standing there waiting for taxis and wasting time. 2) Just book with the hotel concierge for your taxi back to KLIA, it is only rm80 per journey. This is the normal taxi. If you choose the blue colour Limo taxi, it will cost more. 3) Reasons why I choose Cititel Midvalley:a) Location Location Locations of course. It is cheaper than Boulevard/ Garden Hotel. This hotel has no swimming pool though but you can shop till you drop. b) You need not take any taxis to go shopping as all the shops are right at the doorstep. I for one hate to be fleeced by the taxi driver who would ask for flat rate from one short destination to another instead of using the metre rate. c) Check in/out service were fastd) The room has fan and suitable for those who cant stand too much air condition. e) Breakfasts spread was a mix of great variety but if you want to save some money, there are many food outlets a few minutes walk outside the hotel that serve equally good breakfasts at lower price. f) The cleaner left ""Love"" notes for me after each stay for that personal touch. It made me wonder how they have time to write these ""feel good"" notes for every guests. I wont be surprised if the hotel gets school kids to write them but i appreciate these notes and it would be even better if it comes with a small piece of chocolate with these notes. :) My only complaints about the hotel:a) The lif is not bright enough. It would be better if it is brighter and also for SAFETY REASON. b) The toilets too are rather dim. They could use a brighter light bulb. It was difficult for me to put on my makeup as the lighting was not bright enough. Above are my 5 cents thoughts on Cititel Midvalley. Great location for the shopaholic.",4,Cititel Mid Valley

The breakfast is quite nice with a lot of varieties such as nasi lemak, fried noodles, sausages, baked beans, wedges, varieties of bread, porridge, fruits, yogurt, etc. The only downside was that me and my colleagues were not inform that we had to insert the parking ticket at the autopay machine again after validating the ticket at the hotel lobby during check out. At least, the staff at the front office could have given us a simple reminder to insert the ticket again at the autopay instead of letting us park our car awkwardly near the exit gate and had to run to the nearest autopay machine to validate the ticket.. other than that minor problem, this hotel is a good place to stay and convenient indeed.",4,Cititel Mid Valley

The Mid Valley Megamall is literally at the door step. However, the traffic in and out of the hotel was horrible. We were caught in a jam to the hotel on Saturday afternoon. In addition, we felt like we're going around in circles when we reached Mid Valley because of the road layout which gave me a headache. When we wanted to leave the hotel in the late afternoon, we had to wait a while for the staff helped us to get a taxi who is willing to go by meter. When our relatives sent us back late at night, we were caught in the jam created by shoppers who just finished their shopping. There were few taxis and even fewer who were willing to go by meter (may be because of the weekend jam). We were advised to pre-book our taxi for the airport for the same reason. Service on the other hand was good. The staff who checked us in and out were fast and efficient. The housekeeping staff brought the replacement kettle relatively fast when we called to report that it was faulty. The staff who helped us arrange taxis was also helpful and friendly. The staff in the cafe were attentive and will take away the used plates promptly. The thing I like about the room:1) Good view. Can see KL Tower and Twin Tower. Think room numbers ending after 25 will have the same view.2) Room has kettle, hair dryer, slippers and safe. Safe is big enough to store laptop.3) Room has both air-con and ceiling fan. We turned on the fan instead of the air-con as the air-con was very noisy.Things I dislike about the room are mainly related to the bathroom:1) Only 1 double hook behind the bathroom door. No enough place to hang clothes.2) No shelf to put toiletries in the enclosed shower area in the bathroom. No place to hang shower ball either.3) The bathroom mirror is far because of the design of the sink.The lifts are fast (big and always come empty) but the signalling sound is not loud enough, especially when in the main lobby. We frequently missed the lift because we weren't aware that the lift had arrived.WIFI can only connect one device but connection was strong (in the room and in the breakfast area).Breakfast is good with wide selection. Lots of staple (cereals, noodles, white and coconut rice, congee, pancakes, breads, rice noodle rolls, etc). Also had few vegetables, fruits and meat.

I wonder why i should wait for the repair as the everything in the room should be ready for use before i go in. Eventhough there is something malfunctioning, maybe should the hotel try to change another room for me at first instead of asking me to spend my time for the repair? Anyway, he did changed another room for me after i insisted on it and his superior just told him to change. However, I will still prefer the hotel location and hope it can better.",3,Cititel Mid Valley

I stayed at double tree hilton just 2 weeks back at 60 bucks more and that was like 100x better.Even if I took a bigger room, I doubt it would been any better. In detailed explanation:First impression upon arrival- OMG what type of hotel is thisLobby- smelly, crowded, shabby and I dont know if you can call it a lobby after all. The pathway between the mall and the hotel was screwed up that one might trip while walking.Check in counters: Not organized, crowded all the time because there is so little space and few staffs. I booked a non smoking room but was told it would only be ready way past check in time. I was like why on earth would you state check in is at 2 if your rooms are not even ready by then???? Had to settle for a smoking room which was awful.Lifts: DodgyRoom: Matchbox size and for 300+++ with no b/fast, it was 0% worthy of its price. Bed: small!!!!! Only 2 pillows and not so clean sheets. However they willingly gave us 2 more pillows when we called room service.Bathroom: Small but no so bad. But the toiletries were crap. They ran out of shower gel???? Thank god we had our own ones so didnt bother calling up room serviceLocation: the only thing worthwhile it that its attached to midvalley mall and gardens. So for this, I would rate locayion a 5 star. For tourist, its not really a touristy area but for those who intend to shop around in midvalley or gardens, then yes.Food: Never tried and did not intend to.Pool: Not sure it there is one but did not bother checking it out.All in all, would not recommend it to anyone with slightly high expectations and would not come back.And only got to know after my stay that this hotel is actually well known for other activities that I cant write here.",2,Cititel Mid Valley

I would highly recommend this hotel to business traveler, holiday makers with and with out children. Its a fantastic hotel with neat, clean rooms and bathrooms. The staff is excellent and very efficient. Their breakfast buffet is great with multiple choices for non-vegetarians and having ample choice for vegetarians too. Their in room menu is also of a good quality but make sure you order well in advance as they take time to deliver in the room.The location of this hotel is right where every shop-o-holic would want. The big mid-valley mall is adjacent to the hotel with a connecting entrance to the mall. There are couple of other malls in the close vicinity.

Stayed for 2 nights. Initial impression during check-in was not at all pleasant as the staff was 'cold' and unresponsive to queries. Never mind, we were there to relax, so let it be. Amenities in the room was sufficiently stocked. Hot water (shower) was not hot; reported to Reception but instead of advising us on a solution, they just said cannot help much as hotel was full. (I did not ask for room-change but attention to the hot water supply). Anyway, let it past as we just wanted a 2 nights of relaxations.The next morning, as we were leaving the room and informed the maid that there was no shaver in the bathroom.We were out till the late evening where the Superb Experience was discovered. We found a note written by the Maid, welcoming us to the hotel, wishing us a pleasant stay, etc.... That was something that Service Is all About. That note from the Maid totally erased all the unpleasant encounters the day before.It really takes a diligent and committed staff to make a difference.

Public transportation can be found at all entrances/exits. If you dont like the food offered at the hotel, there are other food outlets in the mall and you will surely find one that suits your tastebud.The only 2 complaints I have would be the size of the room which was a little bit too small. We almost had no room for our luggage and the paper thin walls. Our room was closr to the elevator and we could hear each and every stop on our floor and not to mention the footsteps of other guest walking to and from the lift lobby. We could also hear our neighbours muffled voices through our walls. On the last night, our baby had a very bad night and cried throughout the night. I pity our nrighbours because i am sure they could hear everything! Upon check out the next day, the receptionist did ask about the crying because there had been some complaints, but we were grateful no one came knocking on our door that night.

I thought to myself that I can easily find a friend's place to bunk into. LOCATION & CONVENIENCEHowever once I saw how close the hotel is to Mid Valley Megamall (East Atrium entrance), I knew how much time I can save on driving, finding a carpark and waiting in queue of endless traffic of weekends. The hotel location is so close to the mall that it felt like you're living in it. However, the hotel design is so beautiful that my room get a view of the KL Tower and KLCC and simply forgotten about the hustle bustle of the mall. Plus, since my main intention was to attend wedding fair in the mall hence making it so easy to go in and out of my room and at the same time able to check out the fair. Also, very convenient for my friends to look for me as everyone know where is Mid Valley and convenient to come to this place as it was almost the center of KL and Klang Valley. Not only that, the hotel provide a free carpark and this help out a lot when I need to drive in and out of the hotel and skip the carpark queue!FOODIf your room doesn't provide breakfast, no fret! TIPS to FOREIGNER : If you want to experience TRUE MALAYSIAN breakfast, head to the underground floor of Mid Valley Megamall connecting to The Gardens Mall. There we have row of shops that sell pretty good Nasi Lemak and Teh Tarik at a very affordable price. If spicy food is not your cup of tea, you can try the chinese Fried Yoo Tiao (similar to pretzel) to go with either porridge or soya bean milk.Though the mall opens at 10am but the breakfast place opens as early as 8am.DISADVANTAGEHowever there are downside to this; the room is small (felt like I'm staying in Tokyo) and the wifi sucks BIG time. The room is very convenient to couple, friends, business and not so for family unless you get a bigger room.SERVICEOh not forgetting to mention, their cleaner lady actually bid us good morning and thank you!

The rooms are really big and they have just been refurbished, so it looks good. There is also a big shopping complex below. The only downside is the light rail transit (LRT) doesn't have a stop right below and you would need to catch a cab to the nearest LRT.

Nice clean bathroom (see photos).I wish the hotel had a pool - it would have been great in the hot weather of Malaysia.Nonetheless, I had a very pleasant stay there. Price was very reasonable for the level of amenities. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,Cititel Mid Valley

Within minutes upon checking in, somebody came sending the extra bed (and a pillow and an extra towel) that I had requested for. I asked for an extra pillow and the guy told me that there were two in the closet but I said that I would want one more. I had just closed the door as he went out when there was a knock...and there he was - with the pillow! Boy, I sure was impressed.Usually, I would very much prefer to laze around in the room. Thus, whenever we went out for breakfast - the room rate was not inclusive of breakfast at this hotel, I would come back first and nothing would please me more than a room that had been nicely cleaned, everything spick and span.The first morning I was there, I put in a request at the reception counter as it seems to me that at most hotels, they would clean the rooms where the guests have checked out so that they could allocate those the new guests checking in that day...and they would do all the other rooms later. When I came back to the room that first morning when we were there, I found that they did not waste time to see to what I had wanted.I saw the member of the housekeeping staff concerned outside later - an old lady, kind of matronly and very polite and friendly. The next morning, when I came back from breakfast, she was cleaning a room a few doors away and when she saw me, she quickly came to apologise as she had not done my room yet. I said it was perfectly all right and I went out again for a while and minutes later, when I returned, the room was already done.Since that morning, for the rest of our stay, our room would definitely be nice and clean everytime after my breakfast and everytime I saw her when I was going out or coming back, she would be full of smiles and not fail to greet me and carry on a bit of small talk.We checked out after 5 nights at this hotel and all I had to do was to inform the girl at the desk at the time and leave - just a split second for her to check on her computer and then tell me ever so pleasantly that everything had been settled, thank you very much and goodbye. With that kind of very friendly and efficient service, I certainly would not think twice about staying here again.",5,Cititel Mid Valley

Kuala Lumpur,"An Adequate Hotel for Short Visits, But Just Barely",PilotMike2009,Constant Traveller,2016/10/08 22:18:19,59200,Cititel Mid Valley Lingkaran Syed Putra,2013-06-09,Malaysia,"This visit to the Cititel Hotel in Kuala Lumpur was early in June 2013. It was my second stay at the hotel in 18 months, and not much has changed. It is still a solid 3-star hotel, but the frustration is that it could be so much more. Lets start with the good stuff: the location is terrific and very convenient. The hotel is attached to the MidValley Mall, so there are many up-market restaurants and shops. The staff is unfailingly polite. Everything is very clean. Security is excellent. And, as you will see in the photos, the hotel features one of the best breakfast buffets you will find anywhere. So youre thinking, pretty good, right?Sadly, it goes downhill from here.First, the lobby has all the grace and charm of a crowded bus station. This is a vast space that is populated with dozing visitors, running children and traffic-stopping pillars. This lobby is the case study for the phrase, You never get a second chance to make a first impression. How about some flowers? How about some comfortable furniture, or rugs, or even art on the wall? Its not going to happen at Cititel.You also will instantly notice the long line of people waiting to check-in and check-out. There are never enough clerks behind the counter, and it appears their computer systems are clumsy or slow. Everything is recorded on paper records and it takes forever; theres no need for that in todays digital world.Adjacent to the lobby is the Lobby Restaurant and the Lobby Bar. The restaurant works fine and their breakfast is excellent; see photos. But the Lobby Bar is descent into Business Traveller Hell. A more unwelcoming social area would be hard to imagine. The furniture is old and was uncomfortable when it was new. The selections of adult beverages would an embarassment to any self-respecting rest-stop a motorway, much less a hotel bar. The prices are high and the staff bored. On the other hand, nobody is ever in there, so you can always get the best seat in the house.heading upstairs, instead of the usual Superior room, I upgraded to a Delux room and I was very pleased I did. The room was significantly larger  maybe 50% bigger  and the bathroom was much improved. Unhappily, the room dcor was the same tedious design as the smaller rooms  brown walls, brown carpets, brown furniture. It was like living inside a chocolate cookie. The closet was large, there was a luggage rack; the desk properly equipped, and the TV had about 10 channels, including BBC, so kudos to the hotel for getting that correct. But the WIFI access was extremely slow and erratic, making it difficult to collect email or post to TripAdvisor. From my perspective as a constant business traveler, bad WIFI is a total disqualifier. One other little feature that probably will never be corrected but is a source of great frustration: the elevators. Specifically, you cannot tell when your elevator has arrived, and so you often miss the elevator. There is no sound-proofing in the elevator lobby on each floor, so passengers waiting for an elevator confusingly hear the elevators chime on approaching floors. Next, the design of the elevator signal lights means you cannot see the lights (or the opening doors) from any location. The end result of this poor design is the requirement to stand quietly by the elevators, listening for the quiet rumble as the doors open and then, cat-like, pounce into the elevator before it closes. If you are distracted by a Tweet, the doors close and you are left, smart phone in hand, wondering if you will ever make it to the lobby.All in all, this hotel could be much better than it is. Theres nothing you can do to change the room sizes; but they're tolerable. Instead, management should work on fixing the elevators and the WIFI; decorating the rooms and the Lobby Bar; speeding the check-in process; and putting some rugs in the lobby. Instantly this dreary hotel would be transformed and on its way to 4-star status.",3,Cititel Mid Valley
Kuala Lumpur,Bare necessities; watch out for the taxi scammers,TravelingGlutton,"Singapore, Singapore",2016/10/08 22:18:19,59200,Cititel Mid Valley Lingkaran Syed Putra,2013-06-07,Malaysia,"Stayed here on a 4-day work trip. The Superior room is quite small, ok for 1 person but will be cramped for 2. Although marketed as a ""business-friendly"" hotel, the clientele are mostly tourists. I found the wifi internet provided to be extremely slow and unreliable, which is unacceptable for a proper business hotel. It also limits you to 2 devices per room, so if there are 2 people staying, each with 1 laptop and 1 smartphone, good luck trying to juggle who gets to use the internet.The bathroom comes stocked with 2-in-1 shampoo/shower gel that you pump out of a dispenser attached to the wall. Some of the towels I used smelt like gym towels, i.e. had been sweated into and not dried properly during the cleaning process. I tipped housekeeping and left a note to thank them for cleaning my room. I came back at the end of the day to a personalised reply note thanking me for the tip and informing me to dial ""6"" should I need further assistance. That was a very nice gesture and I commend housekeeping for this level of personalised service.I took taxis from the hotel taxi stand on 2 consecutive days. The driver on the second day tried to cheat me by not turning on the meter and only quoting me a price after we had arrived at our destination. When I told him that I had paid less the previous day, he insulted my nationality (seriously?!?!) and tried to drive away. Since I was there for work and did not want any unpleasantness, I agreed to pay his stated price. It was not a good experience and I caution anyone who needs to take a taxi, to hail one off the road (very easily done) or from the taxi stands at the mall instead of from the hotel. Note also that the hotel will write you a slip and ask you to pay an additional RM2 to the driver on top of the meter fare (assuming the driver even turns on the meter). Do yourself a favor and avoid this scam.As long as you don't expect luxury, only need the basic necessities, and stay vigilant for potential scammers, this should be sufficient for your needs. There is no swimming pool nor gym. Breakfast served at the cafe in the morning is passable, but the tea and coffee is frankly mediocre. The best thing about this hotel is the fact that it is connected to the mall complex, which is very convenient for shopping and dining.",3,Cititel Mid Valley

The hotel staff are polite and the check in was very efficient and the entrance lobby is a bright and often busy welcome to the hotel. I had a standard double room on the 21st floor which was a little cramped for me. Two people would struggle with the limited space for sure. Not much wardrobe space and a tiny but ample clean shower room with not much room to lay out your bathroom bits and pieces made up the room layout. Good TV in the room and free wifi made the stay overall quite comfortable and enabled me to do some work in my room. The room however was a little noisy mainly from the giant AC fans situated below the room so if your going to stay here look for a room on the front of the hotel to avoid this. Also you can often hear the adjacent rooms using the bathroom, closing ther curtains etc,etc but I guess overall I slept quite well considering. I had the last day of my trip to myself as I had a late flight home so thought it would be nice to spend some time around the pool. Unbelievably the hotel does not have any pool or patio area for sun worshipping. I was really dissapointed with this and on this basis I give the hotel an only ""average"" rating. Breakfast was OK but probably suits the Asian rather than the western pallet. If you give the limited space in the rooms, lack of pool and some low level noise some consideration before booking I'm sure your stay would be ok.

It's a short cab ride away from the KL Airport Express station. Would I stay here again.....? Possibly, if I were sure that all I needed was a bed for the night, and if budget were a concern. If not, I would look for other options. I did provide my feedback to the hotel manager and got a prompt email response, which does show that the hotel is enlightened about giving a listening ear.

Only problem I had was when it was time to sleep, there was children making a noise in the passages and next door rooms, a loud tv and some other noise makers but calling the reception desk sorted out this problem quickly. With this hotel having so many floors I think families with noisy children should be put on a specific floor and those that value peace and quiet on another floor, so ar this is the only thing that has annoyed me thus far.",4,Cititel Mid Valley

One of them was telling us off with his mouth full of chips and even, chips falling out of his mouth. We told them that we were hotel guest. After 10minutes, another woman appeared and then, asked for room number as though, this is some sort of a crime that we have committed. Whether anyone who is a hotel guest or not, since Malaysia is promoting heavily on tourism and Malaysian hospitality, it does not hurt this hotel staff to be friendly, helpful and courteous.

Finally when it was my turn to check-in, the computer system was down and I am told to wait again. After getting my room key, I was told that they are unable to generate the WIFI login and password as the system was still unresponsive. Was told that the WIFI login and password will be sent to my room in 5 mins (via a phone call) after I rest in my room....waited and waited and still no ringing tone. I have to call and requested for the WIFI login and password.I requested for a high floor room during room reservation but it seems that everyone I met in the lift stayed higher than me (I was given a room at 12 level). Maybe I should be more specific on what level is considered as ""high floor"".The room is a tiny one with basic facilities provided (tv, safe box, small fridge, kettle & hair dryer). The WIFI access only allow 1 user to login at one time. Unlike the rest of other hotel, it will not throw out the existing user when another user tried to login using the same password and I have a hard time relocating the hotel free wifi login page in order to discontinue the free wifi access and let my room-mate to login using her smart-phone. Possible for the hotel to provide 2 users login for the free WIFI in your room?The supply for the toilet roll was not replenished! My room was placed with 2 toilet roll when I checked-in for 2 nites stay. We were left with 1 toilet roll but the housekeeping did not replenished during room clean up. We have to call for replenish when we were really running out of supply! embarrassment!The most unbearable incident was a small cockroach found in my room and I only discovered in on my last night of stay! It was hiding at the TV console, where kettle and free sachets of teas/coffee was placed. It kept crawling around and we have a hard time killing it as we do not want it to migrate with us when we check-out.Apart from the above, this hotel has a superber location where you will have easy access to the mega shopping mall, KL central and Chinatown.

My husband thought it is enough room for two people unless you're trying to have a party in there. Since our luggage is mid size, we manage to fit both of it in the space provided. I was given free wifi but I didn't use it cause you would want to spend all your time at Mid Valley since the location of the hotel is directly linked to it. The link is at coffee bean by the way. We also didn't take the buffet breakfast(which you have to pay for) due to the fact that there's so many more choices at the mall but unless you want to start the day early, I suggest you take it. The shops at the mall do not open till 10am or 10.30am. Don't worry about making a mess in the room, the housekeeping staff will do their duty and make the room nice and sparkling clean again. The in-room dining menu is quite limited. Checking in was a breeze and it is the same for checking out. We had a late check out at 3pm instead of 12pm and they charge us RM100, however they told us that if we stayed till 6pm, it will be half day charged(which is approximately 145?).

The check in & out is usally a breeze, they don't trouble you to fill up the form again when you are a repeat guest, which was really nice. The rooms are small but more comfortable compared to some in Hong Kong.

There is hardly enought space for me to put my luggage (and mine is the small trolly bag). When it comes to shower time, the water is cold. Was later told that we had to let the water run for abt 3mins before the hot water comes. To me .. i think it is simply a waste of water.

The first day we check in to the hotel around 1pm and did not come out after that, so no parking issue. The second day, we went to other places and return to Hotel at night around 10pm. The entrance of hotel parking was blocked and the staff informed us that the hotel parking is full & instructed us to park our car in Mid Valley parking. With our previous bad experience that we will need to pay the parking at Mid Valley after paying for the rooms, we insist not to park in Mid Valley parking but in the hotel parking. Besides, we noticed there's a car exit from the hotel parking during our argument. So we informed the staff and asked him if he could let us in since there was an empty place. Without checking, he immediately replied that theres always a car in and out and asked us to park in Mid Valley parking. We lost our patient and wanted to remove the block our self. He then only allows us to go in and we immediately saw an empty parking and park our car. We understand the parking places were limited but what upset us was the staff attitude being ignorance.

My advice would be to pay an extra 15-20 usd per night and stay at the Boulevard Hotel that is newer and located at the other end of the Mid Valley Megamall, right there. Oh, they charge extra for wifi in the rooms too, which is a bit annoying. I wouldn't use Cititel again unless other options were full, or until they upgrade their units.",3,Cititel Mid Valley

If you have a lot of luggage moving around the room gets more difficult. Reception staff were largely pleasant. Breakfast has a good array of dishes but it all seemed to look a lot better than it tasted - ended up sticking with porridge as the rest was consistently disappointing. Being attached to the shopping mall is great. If they added a few more facilities (it seems odd that there's no gym OR swimming pool) and updated the rooms it would be a much more enjoyable place to stay.,3,Cititel Mid Valley

After I repeated that I wanted valet services, the valet attendant was rude by saying 'bayar dulu' which directly translate to 'pay first'. When I took out the cash to pay, he was already standing at the my car and told me to bring my keys over to him to park the car and told me to wait for my keys instead of holding on to them till when I wanted to collect my car other than not providing the receipt. In addition to that, he wanted to back step out of the car with an angry face to confront me when I said 'the service here sucks', if my sister didn't apologize to him on my behalf at that time, I fear that my safety as a guest at Cititel Mid Valley would have been compromised.

We came back and finds that everything was just like how we left them before we go out. since that it's already evening, and we are quite tired and understands that if house keeping is done, it will take us another 30 minutes so we decided not ask for 1. 2) Power socket is very limited. When I say limited, means that you are not able to find more than 1 power socket in the room. The only 1 that I can find is behind the TV. I did not notice the power socket until i need to iron my shirt. The room has it's own iron and ironing board in the cupboard, but to iron a shirt, you need to place it near the TV because that is the only 1 socket I can find. 3) Parking is a bit problematic if you comes back late at night because the hotel parking might be full and you will need to pay a flat rate of RM5 in Midvalley parking lots.

Infested with bed bugs!,Gina Y,"London, United Kingdom",2016/10/08 22:18:48,59200,Cititel Mid Valley Lingkaran Syed Putra,2011-12-28,Malaysia,"My boyfriend book this hotel for us to stay at in KL for a week (20/12/11 - 27/12/11). Having read some of the reviews, we chose this hotel for its convenient location. We also booked another room for my parents as I flew them over to KL for the Xmas holidays. I thought it would be easy for them to have Mid Valley Megamall just next to the hotel so that they could do some shopping and easily find restaurants for their lunches and dinners. However, the location is the ONLY thing good I can say about this hotel. Halfway through our stay here, I woke up at 1.30 am in the morning and found bedbugs crawling on my bed! It was so disgusting and horrifying. I found more than 3 on mine and 1 on my boyfriend's bed (They gave us a twin bed). I crushed the bedbugs on a couple of tissues and dragged my boyfriend to the reception counter. I handed the tissues that contained the bed bugs to the staff at the reception desk and she herself dropped the tissue in disgust! All she could do was apologise and said she would change our rooms for us. I was so angry that a hotel like Cititel would provide such rooms for their guests. I know this is not a 5* hotel and I did not expect 5* treatments BUT I did pay a lot of money for their hotel room (it was peak period in Dec) and the least they could do was provide me with a clean bed! Is that so much to ask for? I was beyond exhausted to argue with the staff as it was almost 2am in the morning and we had to pack all our stuff back into the luggage and move it to the new room (we were in Room 1613 and was moved to Room 1504)!!! I was tempted to cancel my reservations and move to a different hotel but my parents were leaving the next day and I didnt want to inconvenience them. We were due to check out a day after my parents and the hotel only gave us a call the day before we left to check if we were ok and if we were 'bitten' by the bedbugs. I had bites all over the right side of my body as I sleep on my right side (see pictures which I will attach with this review). The funny thing was my parents bed were ok but I ended up with the bug infested ones! You can call me unlucky but seriously the hotel needs to maintain good quality standards. There is NO excuse in this case! I am going to write a formal letter of complaint to the management, the local paper and the national consumer complaints centre on this. They need to ensure that this doesnt happen to other hotel guests. In hindsight, I would probably have screamed at the staff and demanded a refund (highly doubt they would have given me any refund!). I had such a terrible experience here that I would never recommend this hotel not even to my worst enemy. If you do decide to book this hotel, good luck and I hope you dont wake up with bedbugs crawling all over your body!",1,Cititel Mid Valley

However, it was a great dissapointment for our latest visit. First disaster happen when we check in at 2.30pm on Monday, 12 December 2011. When we arrive at the hotel by car and wanted to park at the hotel car park, the hotel complimentary carpark are full and we have told by the hotel's receptionist as to park our car at Mid valley's carpark. As the hotel guest, we felt very dissatisfied that we need to pay for the car park fees just because of the Hotel's poor arrangement and lack of facilities. However, the staff at the check in couter convinced us the parking fees will be bear by the hotel as long as we produce the car park ticket to the front desk with our room key before exiting the hotel. but there was a conditions that we need to park at least 5 hours for this complimentary carpark. so we decided to take a rest in my relative's room and wait for others family for dinner. When we produce our parking ticket at the front desk after 5 hour parking, the staff only valid our car park ticket and ask us to pay RM5 at the car park payment counter. we were shock and inform the staff what have been told to us earlier on when we park our car. However, she did'nt provide any reasonable answer to us and only repeat that we need to pay RM5 for the parking fees and the rest will be absorb by the hotel. We are very Dissapointed and dissatisfied with the information given. however, we think there were no point arguing with them and waste our time. so we just proceed to the car park payment. However, there was another big shock for us after we paid the RM5 for our 5 hours park at the carpark. It was written there that:-Weekdays: 1st 3 hour RM2Subsequent hour RM1so for our 5 hours car park it should be 1st 3 hour RM2 + (Subsequent hour RM1 x 2hours) = RM4, but howcome after so call ""complimentary car park validity"" by the cititel hotel, we end up paying extra RM1 for the car park. we felt being cheat by the hotel and it was very unfair for us as the hotel customer. although it was only RM1 but it was cheating as we were being told different information by different people and we end up paying extra for the car park rate which is published public.Second nightmare was after 12 hours flight, our families could not get into the room immediately. instead, we have to carry the luggage up and down between 15th floor and lobby for 3 times just because the staff did not prepare the room card properly. it was exhausting and tiring for our families after such a long flight. it never should have happen in the 1st place for cititel hotel such a reputated hotel.Conclusion is, we will never come back to cititel hotel and definitely would not recomment this hotel to anyone. our families will return to KL on the christmas and for sure we will try out other hotel at midvalley like gardens instead of coming back to this cititel hotel. we were so much dissapointed and felt embarassed to let our families facing this kind of issues.

We were given a superior room at level 15 which had a nice view of KL city. Contrary to other reviewers, the size of the room was ok and it was generally very well-maintained. My minor gripe was the cable TV which offered very limited selections of Channels.Service - The lobby of Cititel was like a busy command centre, always busy with guests considering the huge number of rooms this business hotel has. Check-in and check-out took a while but we found the smiley staffs to be courteous and accomodating most of the times. Meals - We had breakfast at the hotel lobby and it was generally good with a wide selections. As usual, breakfast period gets very busy and I could see the overworked staffs trying their very best to serve the guests. Location - the Hotel is served by the erratic KTM Commuter Station which made public transportation a nightmare. There was however a frequent shuttle bus service from the adjoining Mid Valley Mall that connected to the Bangsar LRT Station. From the LRT Station, we could get to anywhere in KL easily within 30 minutes. However, I won't consider the hotel to be strategically located for an average first time tourist unless they are contented with shopping within Mid Valley Mall.Price - The price is relatively steep for a business hotel with no other facilities. A swimming pool would be a plus even though I could foresee the crowds.Overall - The room was great, the service was good for a busy hotel, price was slightly on a high note and the location was only so-so in my opinion.

Kuala Lumpur,Super Convenient,Me^Only,"Singapore, Singapore",2016/10/08 22:18:53,59200,Cititel Mid Valley Lingkaran Syed Putra,2011-10-26,Malaysia,"I booked this hotel 2 days (on 13 Oct) before my trip (15 Oct) (Which is really last min) on the Hotel own website & got a rate of the Superior room@ S$90; which I think is so reasonable (Comparing the rate of the same hotel on some other website). And I also check out Hotel Boulevard rate, which charge btw S$145 to S$150 on different Hotel booking website.Took the Coach from LCCT to KL Sentral & Transfer to KTM Komuter to Mid Valley @ RM$1.00. Reach Mid Valley station in under 5min. Walk up the station & follow the crowd to the mall :D Entrance via the escalator. Saw Cititel exterior along the way.I walked in the Mall for about 3min & reach the central podium with the Information counter on the left; here I turn & walked about 30m & turn into a side corridor before Coffee Bean. The Hotel have a side entrance (By the side of Dragon-I restaurant; that lead U directly to the Mall. How wonderful :DCheck in was a breeze, atleast for me @ 2pm sharp. I was attended by Siti at the Check out Counter (Cos no one was there to Check out & Check in counter already have guest checking in). I told Siti my request in my booking & that I am there to give a friend a surprise (That friend only arrived at the same hotel later that evening). And under 10min I was given my room key & was ask if I prefer The New Straits Time or the Chinese Paper. I took the Lift to the 12th floor & was so glad to find a room with a Queen bed as requested, not to mention the View that look towards KLCC (Petronas Twin Tower).......The room have a Ceiling fan, LCD TV, Coffee & Tea (with electric kettle), an Empty fridge (Which I can stock up on later), a study desk with the hairdryer at the drawer below.The shower room have the Gel that work well both as a Shampoo & Shower Gel. Soap, Toothbrush with Toothpaste are also provided (Yeah, U dun have to bring a single of those). The shower stall is big enough (Unless U plan to do Kungfu while shower).The carpet on the bedroom side looks new to me & have no stains. The room is Big enough even if 2 people are in it. And they provide bedroom slipper too.Right out of my bedroom window, I can see Hotel Boulevard on my right, Petronas Twin Tower infront of me & Mid Valley KTM Station down there. Although the Big Aircon Fan duct of the Mall is abit noisy during the day, it does not cause any disturbance to my sleep at nite (I believe It was turn off before midnight). The water flow in the water basin is very slow (Not sure if it is just the room I am in).On one of the morning, I just wish that the Cleaner do not start Vacuuming the corridor before 10am (I can hear the vacuuming before 9am, outside my room). And Maybe because my room was only 1 room away from the housekeeping storeroom, I can hear sound coming from it, especially when they push their trolley on the concrete floor. Otherwise, the housekeepers that i met are friendly, they greet guest good morning when they see U & not just smile at U.On my stay I can hear One of Lift door smashed closed with a Loud metal bang (It happen to the lift nearer to the phone by the window. (Last lift on right side as U face KLCC) & I can hear from my room 1202. And the fan; will start creaking after it is turned on for sometime, otherwise the Aircon work good for me too.And i noticed that the Hotel allow Guest to self check out (This if you want to avoid the Queue). My check out at the counter was a breeze but I definitely did not find the Girl Friendly enough (She forgot to smile).I could spend 3 full day at the mall connected to it & not get sick of it. One never have to worry about not enough to eat, shop or see. The McDonald at the mall basement open early & not to mention other breakfast place around the mall.I simply love Cititel Mid valley (Though I initially thought it gonna be like Cititel Georgetown where I have recently stayed in). I will be back with my Family & stay in the same Hotel; if I head in that direction in the near future.For the rate i paid, I like this Hotel. Good Job Cititel Mid Valley, Keep up the good work & make sure all room are well maintain as usual.",4,Cititel Mid Valley
Kuala Lumpur,very good location for shopping convenience,PrincessStrawberry,Philippines,2016/10/08 22:18:53,59200,Cititel Mid Valley Lingkaran Syed Putra,2011-10-18,Malaysia,"Cititel Mid Valley is a haven for people who likes to shop a lot. The mall beside the hotel is huge with tons of branded boutiques to choose from. Do not expect so much on the hotel rooms, they maybe a bit small compared to most hotels. If you are traveling alone, maybe this won't be a big issue, if you are traveling with a companion, just check with the hotel first if they have rooms to fit your requirements. The room is complete with a double size bed, small bedside tables, a closet, flat screen tv, kettle (2 cups, coffee, tspoon, creamer, sugar and tea), you are also provided with 2 bottles of mineral water daily. The bathroom is a bit small too with just shower and no bathtub. Cleanliness, is a small issue though. There's dust everywhere, the kettle tray is very dusty, they do not use a trash bag on the bins. I also do not think that they spray the room with an air freshner or something after making up the room. The hotel staffs are very friendly. The wifi is not free, you pay Rm30/day for the connection that is really bad. It goes on and off in minutes. I couldn't stay long without being cut off. If you are traveling and you like to go out a lot, then staying in this hotel will not give you any problem at all. My friends are able to pick me up from my hotel without any hassle, i think there is a small traffic jam on the way to the hotel but compared to other hotels, this is much accessible to them. If you are meeting with friends and plans to go out and not stay in the hotel, it is best for you to meet them outside the hotel, in the entrance since parking maybe a problem.",4,Cititel Mid Valley

The price has increased yet the service does not improve. Check in is very slow (average 3 minutes per guest even for me who have corporate account with the hotel). The process is made even worst due to lots of guests all the time, thanks to the great location of the hotel. Midvalley megamall is one of the biggest in KL and has plenty of stuff you can shop for, including 2 big book shops (MPH and Borders). The hotel room is small. It has both air cond and ceiling. corporate rate comes with free internet but the speed is very poor except in off peak hour such as early morning. Breakfast is average. The choice is decent but repetitive and lacks of cheese and salmon. The boil egg is nice, though. Doesn't come with gym or swimming facility and rather expensive for a 3 stars hotel. However, location is the greatest advantage of this hotel. It is better if the hotel can have sort of loyalty reward program",3,Cititel Mid Valley

The only hotel at Malaysia where I found Indian plug points. Room is a small one but compact. Location is brilliant. Just next to the gigantic shopping mall. There is another one within 100 mts. Even the subway station is also within 200 mts. Surely a place where you can use a public transport instead of taking a taxi. Overall a good stay. Breakfast is also good.,4,Cititel Mid Valley
Kuala Lumpur,"A fine business hotel, shame about the rooms!",PilotMike2009,Constant Traveller,2016/10/08 22:18:55,59200,Cititel Mid Valley Lingkaran Syed Putra,2011-09-18,Malaysia,"I stayed at the Cititel Mid-Valley in Sept 2011, after having to check out of the Summit Hotel because my room was dirty and the bathroom stinky. Overall I found that the Cititel is a fine business hotel. You will be able to stay there without worries: it's safe, it's busy; it offers all the right services; it's clean; and it's modern. But, it is not without it's quirks. I paid $80 a night for my room.The building itself is relatively new and modern. It's a big hotel -- about 700 rooms, on 29 floors. Because of it's size, highway access is a bit of an issue. The hotel and it's adjoining mall are on a hill-top, and the roads getting into the hotel twist and turn around the buildings. The roads are usually one-way and -- in my visit -- always jammed. Getting a taxi also is an issue -- there generally is a queue every morning for taxis, so get in line early.The lobby is bright and spacious, check in was fast (but I saw long lines at check-out, so again, get in line early), there's an abundance of elevators and the staff is very helpful.In the lobby there are two restaurants and a bar. The larger restaurant is also the breakfast buffet, which is absolutely top-notch. The bar is boring and dead, although they did have a nice malbec from Chile that surprised me. The rooms are tiny, and I mean T-I-N-Y. This is not a hotel to bring the family -- you simply won't fit. There's no room for a luggage rack for your suitcase; in fact, there's barely room to walk around the end of the bed. The bathrooms also are super-small. Now everything is clean, and worked fine, so I'm not complaining. But look at the photos to see how I had to store my suitcase.The in-room internet worked fine and fast, although you have to renew your password daily. There was no luggage rack in the room. There was no 110v electricity for my razor. There was free bottled water and a mini-bar.Special safety note: the bath towels are stored on a rack above the toilet. I accidentally pulled down a towel as I was reaching for it from the shower and, sure enough, it fell right into the comode. Ever try to dry yourself with a soaking wet towel? So please -- put the lid down.One other minor annoyance: there are five elevators, and service is generally good. But the call button doesn't always light up when you push it to call an elevator, an dthey don't always chime when the arrive at your floor to pick you up. So you have to keep spinning, like a dervish, to see if a lift has arrived! (Maybe other floors don't have this problem.)The shopping mall is excellent. It's brighly lit, jammed with shops; there must be a dozen restaurants, and on the 4th floor is a movie theater with 29 different screens. This is a huge upgrade from the dingy and disorganized shopping mall at the Summit Hotel.Overall, this hotel will work fine for the single traveller or a two-some that is traveling light.",3,Cititel Mid Valley

Overall I didn't have any problem parking my car at the basement during the day or night during my stay.4) Wifi is NOT free, chargeable per day is Malaysian Ringgit 30. Speed was average only, but consistent connection.5) Front Desk- were very helpful in getting the rooms early and late check-out too was allowed. They were great,No issues with them,they were full of smile and helpful whenever you are at the lobby area.6) The hotel even had express checkout, whereby you drop your key cards in an envelope and write all the required information on the envelope and drop it at the front desk area, no waiting and efficient (of cause the credit card details are given already..:),they can post you the bills or even email to you)7) The bathroom tiles needs a changed,it looks old and thrashed out, bathroom is big and spacious.8) The furniture's in the room are just ok, perhaps the management can provide a better working table instead of a long glass panel table which the width is small and felt uneasy put my hands on it and working with my laptop. Carpets needs to be changed as many cigarettes marks visibly seen (my room was a smoking room).9) Bed is good and comfy,no issues of having a comfortable sleep.10) Has a LCD tv, channels seems to be limited, nothing of interesting.Overall a good location hotel, for shopping, and easy access to and within the city center.",4,Cititel Mid Valley

For families and visitors to Malaysia who rent cars and need a parking space, this hotel does not guarrantee adequate parking facilities and at times, struggles to justify its policy's on handling outstation guests who then end up spending 45 minutes to an hour in the shopping center parking area looking for an empty space.That is, IF you can find a parking space and parking is not cheap. An over night parking charge from 9pm-10am will cost you RM16.00.I have more than sufficient proof of the brothel in question on the 3rd floor so to deny such a place exists within the hotel would be pointless.I also have an issue with the hotel's smoking policy in the lobby. It is supposed to be smoke free but the management are too lax about this.Management NEEDS to either ensure the SPA on the 3rd floor provides a PROPER massage and gym services or close the brothel. You can't have both!Hotel gets a bad review because of this.",2,Cititel Mid Valley

The website was appallingly slow. I tried 3 times before I finally got through to the final page. By that time, I was too frustrated to pay much attention to the details.To my horror, I realized after confirming the transaction that I have forgotten to change the default date of 17 May to 21 May.I immediately canceled my reservation! I called the help desk to explain and a manager by the name of Mr. Ronnie was kind enough to offer to waive the charges (RM250) of my booking upon hearing my explanation. I requested also for him to send me an email confirming our agreement. To which, he agreed. It was pleasant up to then. It all went downhill from my stay on. I checked in to the hotel on 21 May at 1:45pm. I asked the front desk officer if i could check-in 15 minutes earlier as the official check-in time is 2pm. She replied that i can only check-in at 3pm without so much as an apology!!! I asked for an explanation and she simply said that the hotel was fully booked and it was an ongoing problem therefore implying that i should just accept it as it is!I lost my patience then! I asked her how come the problem hasn't been resolved if it has been going on for some time. Instead of assuaging my frustration, she went on to comment ""it is the management's fault and yet as front liners, we are the one who has to bear the brunt of the problem!"". I decided that something has to be done. Hence i asked her how can i write an official feedback to the management to highlight the problem instead of taking it out on her. Her immediate response was to check if there were other rooms available!!! Within 5 minutes, i managed to check-in to my room!!!Such service is atrocious!!! So Cititel is prioritizing guests who complaints as opposed to guests who asked politely? After my unpleasant stay, I fully expect to receive some updates on the refund promised to me. Unfortunately, i didn't hear from Mr. Ronnie nor anyone from Cititel. Thinking that they may need time to process the waiver, I waited for 2 week before calling up to clarify.I found out that Mr. Ronnie is out of the office and he didn't leave any records of our conversation nor did he follow through with any actions. Because of Ronnie's irresponsibility, I had to repeat myself to 2 other managers by the name of Ms. Intan and Mr. Mohammad Rasyikin Rosli respectively. Both promised me that they will resolve the matter for me. To-date, I am still being charge for the reservation even though i was promised otherwise. I have not received any reply from my email from Cititel since my last email on 26 June requesting for a confirmation on the date of refund. The incident happened on 17 May. It takes 2 months to process a refund? Is it Cititel's policy to ignore guests' email? I travel extensively for work and leisure, but never had i experience such appalling service from hotels. Never again at Cititel!!! Horrible service from irresponsible management team!!!",1,Cititel Mid Valley

The negative point is just there are too many people at the lobby and long Q at the reception because the system alwys hang. Overall its ok.",4,Cititel Mid Valley

Staff are friendly but expect the hotel to be taken over by large groups of Chinese and Korean tourists, plus a fair share of businessmen. Excellent location for the Shopping Centre which is linked directly to Lobby Level. The Shopping Centre has a nice line of cafes and restaurants at the back, try Gloria Jean for free Wi-Fi. If you're using KL as a stopover, probably best to get a more centrally located hotel but for the budget-conscious like us, we didn't mind spending a bit on taxis (quite cheap) and using the trains.

At 25th floor of the building, it gave an excellent view of the whole city from the window of my room. I got one of the best shots from my camera, incl. the Petronas & KL TV Tower.Though rooms are small, but at the above price, don't expect bigger than this. Its neat & clean.The restaurant at the G. Floor serves the best of choices incl. continental, Indian, Japanese, Malaysian, Korean delicacies. I relish their masala Omelet.You get the choice of smoking or non-smoking floor.The only prohibition in the Hotel is their local fruits Durian & Rambutans. Though, don't miss it eat it, incl. Dragon Fruit.Cititel is well connected to the city through metro service and mid valley station is at just a walking distance. Though, conditions is Metro trains are not good, which are at least 10 - 12 years old. However, considering the cost of the traveling & city traffic at the peak hours, its the best option.The hotel is next to the Mega Mall, which is one of the biggest hyper market of Kuala Lumpur and gives a great shopping experience with the best of world's brand available there. The food court at the top floor of the Mall has all varieties of foods from the diff. countries. All leading food chains KFC, McD, Pizza Hut are available. Only exception was the Indian cuisine, which was a big surprise to me. Not a single restaurant from India, despite of thousands of Indians visiting this Mall. Second its non-vegetarians paradise.

Last time we stayed for 4 days. this time it was just for one night, but the standard had dropped significantly since then.We had booked a non-smoking room with breakfast. The room we were given was run down and needed refurbishment. Also someone had been smoking in it before we arrived. The safe did not work and we had to make alternative arrangements to protect our valuables. We also had to stick close tp the hotel and the Megamall, because Kuala Lumpur is very unsafe for people carrying things near the street. There are lots of violent bag snatchers in this city. Perhaps more drastic action is needed if Malaysia is to protect and grow a decent tourist industry. It is a wonderful country with lots of intesting things to see and do and most of the people are great.The breakfast was as usual for Malaysians.

Less than RM 200, I got a decent room and could have free parking during my stay. What's there not to like. Whenever I go to Mid-valley to shop, this is my first choice. Since I did not chose breakfast in hotel, it was cheaper. Anyway, with so many choices to eat in Mid-Valley, there's no need for a buffet breakfast. Since I spend most of my time out and only returns to sleep and bathe, I was not bothered about the size of the room.

I'm always appreciative for early checkin's since there's nothing much to do for early travellers as most shops are still closed.Room i booked was a superior room which is suppose to be smaller. Room wasn't that bad though its one of the smaller ones i've stayed in before. Definitely not for those who like big spacious place to live in. Bed was nice and not too hard. Bathtub's are only available for deluxe rooms. There was 2 of us but only one pair of disposable slippers. Didn't make any complaints since none of us used it anyway. Staffs were overall friendly, helpful and prompt although not all are very knowledgeable if you are looking to ask for directions around.The only major complaint i have about the hotel was the lift. During peak periods, you can wait on and on before you can finally squeeze in. I can't recall the number of times i gave up to climb up and down the stairs since i wasn't living on a very high floor. At least it meant i got my daily exercise. The internet can be free if you spend above a certain amount at their restaurants. Seems like most other countries offer free internet even in their mid range hotel rooms but KL hotels don't offer that unless you're get the higher class rooms.Breakfast was acceptable but variety is limited. There's actually a food court at B1 in the shopping mall where you can get more variety or you could settle for Macdonald's. I doubt i will book breakfast again during my stay next time.*do be careful when going out for late supper as my friend's friend was robbed around 3am in the morning. the place around the hotel isn't that safe at night.",4,Cititel Mid Valley

Since founding Cititel, we're hooked! We'll probably stay at the hotel again soon. I must say that apart from its wonderfully perfect and strategic location (you can find EVERYTHING you need at Midvalley Megamall), the hotel boasts some very very good value rooms that are no doubt basic, but very comfortable and most importantly clean and quite well maintained. Sure, some of its furnishings and appliances are a little dated, but its not a cause for concern or complaint. They're still in very good use. We stayed at the Superior room which is a tad small but as i said, for value, you can't get any better than this. Our room didn't come with breakfast, but with the hotel's close proximity to endless selection of eateries, who needs breakfast at the hotel?!I'd fully recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good weekend getaway, especially away from the city centre.To the hotel management reading this review - Keep it clean and simple!

What gets it going and keeps it busy is its fantastic location being connected directly to a large, busy shopping mall. The buffet breakfast (included in our rates) was also something we look forward to each visit. The basic rooms are small but meet our needs so it's alright. Avoid the rooms near the power generators as it can get noisy. This latest visit in December was a busy time for the hotel, so it felt very crowded in the reception and breakfast areas. At the end of the stay, I summarise it as a ""fast food"" hotel. Meets your needs for a clean, safe and convenient place to stay; but not many frills and no feel (no ambience). As alluded to at the start, the prices have been rising year on year. It used to be S$80+ a few years back.

On entering the room I was surprised to see the Petronas Twin towers & KL Menara straight from my room window. Very close to the hotel was a mono rail station where I could see mono rails, & metro trains from KL Ekspress & other service plying regularly. Every night through my 4 day stay I could see the different color illumination being done at the tin towers which was a marvelous sight.The rooms, although slightly small, are extremely neat & clean with good ambience with due consideration give to convenience & relaxation.The hotel lobby is great & an excellent restaurant with a wide variety of cuisine available, the restaurant is a delight for any food aficionado.

I was looking for a decent hotel in the right location that would be reachable to the conference location and also be reachable to train lines to travel to Sentral or KLCC. Since our travel plans changed and one of our colleagues did not join in, the two of us planned to vacate a suite in another hotel and shift to a smaller but a good hotel room with a better lifestyle location with convenience of travel. We landed up at Cititel. Since the walk-in rates for the hotel room were around MYR265 for a double room, we checked up the price on the internet which was much lesser and booked it online. Although we shifted hotels and arrived in much earlier and had no vacant rooms till our official check-in time, the staff was very courteous and accomodated the baggage, completed the check-in formalities so that we could get on with the day's stuff. The room by iteself was quite small, with a bed occupying the whole room with just some space to walk around, which is quite unlikely for a four starrer. So, if you are travelling with a large suitcase or travelling with your family, this may not be the place for you. Since we were there for business and wanted a decent place to rest and good mall where could find food, this hotel proved to be a great choice for us.The best thging about the hotel was its location. We could reach our destination for about MYR10-12 one way and the destination didnt have any bus connectivity. But in the evenings and the weekend, mid-valley proved to be a great place to move around to and from by bus. However, I dont recommend travel by KTM Kommuter from the nearby mid-valley station as the train frequency is hopeless. The mall down below runs a free shuttle service to the more active Bangsar station. As regards food, we have no idea about the service or food quality in the restaurant. We were on the 'no-breakfast' option in the hotel so as to save some money on that front. As regards the amenties in the room, the AC was working and the bathrooms were neat and cleaned daily. We were provided with 2 bottles of water daily too. Of the things in the room, one thing that didnt seem to work was the electronic safe. But, we didnt really bother to get asssistance about it since we carried important documents with us on person. But, ideally it should have been working in the normal fashion.",4,Cititel Mid Valley

Towels are changed daily but they have damp smell. 24 hour wireless Internet is available at the cost of RM 60 or about $20. Great connection but rather expensive. If you choose this hotel and are looking for a nice place to dine, go to ""Delicious"" at a mall close to the hotel. The restaurant offers both Malaysian and international food at a reasonable price.

Deluxe room which was spacious and clean. However unable to use air conditioning as it sounded like a tractor so nights were uncomfortable.Breakfast was an absolute disaster, dirty tables even if you could find somewhere to sit, lots of food choice but all poor quality, no service at all.However this was far from the worst of staying in this hotel!On the last day we were there (Sunday) I was awoken by noise outside our bedroom door of people talking loudly and somewhat excitedly. I thought how thoughtless of them until after about half an hour the level of noise began to increase until all of a sudden there was the sounds of people running down the hallway screaming, shouting, singing and hooting, door banging etc. This woke my husband and we gingerly opened the door to see 30-40 people running up and down the hallway and that and had gained access to a room further down the hall which was apparently occupied by friends of theirs.We called the front desk and asked for something to be done. Half an hour later no action had taken place and I rang down again to be told that they were sending security. Ten minutes after that still no action so I decided to take a chance and go down to reception although I was very concerned about venturing into the corridor. On my way down I met houskeeping staff who were also worried and had reported what was going on and other guests phoning reception from the hall phone.On arrival at reception I was told that security had just gone upstairs with the duty manager and security.I went back up to see the manager hovering in the hallway and a young security guard with his hands behind his back and standing behind the manager. The manager first told me he couldnt do anything because they were Chinese which I said was irrelevant but then the worst thing was he then said he couldnt do anything because they werent guests of the hotel.I said that in such a case he should be calling the police and he just shrugged and said he thought he had agreed with them that if he left them to it they would all leave the hotel in the next 15-30mins.Needless to say they didnt leave until they felt good and ready by which time we were checking out.I filled in one of the comment forms and ticked the box requesting a call from the hotel manager. I am not surprised that I have heard nothing and I do urge anyone who is thing of booking here because of its location to be very careful especially if children are with you. the most scary experience I have had in a hotel",1,Cititel Mid Valley

Nice views across KL toward towers if you are lucky enough to face that direction.

Hotel is primarily a business hotel but it would also suit tourist staying two three days as it is only twenty minutes from KL centre and is reasonable located for KL Sentral (2mins) and even airport (40mins) Overall a nice hotel wbich benefits from being new so relatively clean but this may change over time,4,Cititel Mid Valley
Kuala Lumpur,"Don't bother the Superior, go for Deluxe!",cirque,"Jakarta, Indonesia",2016/10/08 22:19:14,59200,Cititel Mid Valley Lingkaran Syed Putra,2009-08-19,Malaysia,"BookingBooking was done through hotel website www.cititelmidvalley.com It's easy to use and directly confirm the room reservation. I booked for 2 superior rooms for 2-night stay. Since I booked it last minute and other KL hotels were full at intended date of stay, I called the hotel 2 days prior to arrival to make sure they have the rooms for me and told them I'll be checked-in late.Check-inArrived at the hotel around 11pm. Sadly, staff said all superior rooms are full (how come after 2 days prior I made a call and assured by them?). Initially check-in staff (Murad) offered 1 deluxe room with an extra bed. I argued my objection, and after he discussed with a colleague: magically he gave 1 deluxe room and 1 superior room for the 1st nite and 2 superior rooms for the 2nd nite as booked initially.Deluxe RoomOur deluxe room were spacious: One can even set a tent and camp there! Plus, it's on the top floor; 28th floor. I didn't complaint much although it did not have the Twin Tower/KL city view (our room was facing the other direction). Bathroom was also spacious with separate shower and bathtub; a scale, full toiletries (shower cap, sanitary bag, toothbrushes, cotton buds & pads, razor set, and all kind of soaps), full-range of towels (face, hand, body, 2 bath mats). For entertainment, it has LCD TV (see photo) with around 12 channels (not much, but can do). Internet access (wireless or wired) need to pay though, so don't bother about it. Wardrobe swings full set (with 2 bathrobes, pretty huge safe box (not for A laptop, even 10 laptops can fit in!), iron/ironing board. Complimentary tea/coffee making facility with very clean (I bet it's new) kettle! The bed was quite a disappointment though. It looked nice at first (see photo), but it's so firm that my back was hurt in the morning. 2 choice of pillows (one firm and one soft) were nice tough. Also in the morning, I noticed that although the pillow and duvet have same pattern, they do not come in same colour (the duvet is more yellowish). Superior RoomAs other reviewer said, the superior room is quite compact (but still okay for the price you pay), but it's a huge scaled down if you compare to the deluxe room (rates difference is around RM60 only!) The room features a double bed (with stain marks on its duvet, don't bother to check how's the sheet as I were too lazy to inspect everything), old 14inch TV, tea/coffee making facility (comes with 2 mugs, instead of tea cups and a moldy kettle which quality far below those at deluxe room), smallish safe box (even your 15,4inch laptop can't fit in!), in the bathroom only 2 body towels and 1 bath mat plus not-so-complete toiletries were given (only shower cap, sanitary bag, and cotton buds)The good side from the room was clean, free of smoke smell (although it's in smoking floor), clean bathroom, and thermostat worked perfectly.Check-outCheck out can be done quickly as the hotel has its own 'express check-out' stand whereby guest who wish to check out can just fill in the form and drop it into the box. The manual check-out counter is also available. StaffVery nice hotel manager. Bell service is also good. Front desk staff who work morning shift is more cheerful than the evening shift.RestaurantI can spot 1 restaurant in the lobby; Citi Cafe. Guest who book online can opt for buffet breakfast at RM16 (or RM35 for walk-in) per person. However, as the hotel is adjacent to a mall, one can get full-breakfast set from other cafes in the shopping mall for less than that price. Also, you can save money to buy bottled mineral water (RM1) from Carrefour inside the mall rather than buying extra mineral water from the cafe (RM4). Travel TipsDon't bother calling a taxi through bell service. The bellman / taxi maid will coordinate with taxi-mafia that standby around the lobby. They never want to use taxi meter, instead will charge you flat rate (which mostly will costs you more than what you pay if using meter). Instead, go to the mall, head to any of its lobby (I always go to the South Lobby - near Dome cafe) where there's a taxi stand with rope. The taxi driver who waits there is willing to use meter (but have to ask him first before embarking!).My experience: if you take meter-taxi (from the South Lobby) to Sunway Lagoon, it only costs RM10. If you're calling taxi using bell service from hotel, they will charge you RM20 onwards!",3,Cititel Mid Valley
Kuala Lumpur,Great Value and Great Service,BusyDaddy,Singapore,2016/10/08 22:19:14,59200,Cititel Mid Valley Lingkaran Syed Putra,2009-06-15,Malaysia,"I admit I was a bit apprehensive of staying at the hotel, especially after reading other reviews in this forum, and knowing that older hotels in Malaysia tend to be quite run down unless there have been extensive upgrading and renovation. The fears melted away when I first opened the door to a roomy Deluxe Room, which was neat and clean. Amenities-wise, one could not ask for more i.e. an iron (with board), safe, large Sony LCD TV, coffee and tea making facilities, and fridge. My only disappointment in this area was the lack of free broadband, but at least you could still pay for wireless access at fair rates, or just go down to the Coffee Bean on the ground floor to catch up on your E-mail.Yes, the room did show its fair share of wear and tear, and smelled musty when you first enter the room when the aircon has not been on, but these did not stop us from getting a good night's sleep, and that's what matters.One of the more noteworthy observations is that more than half of the floors are non-smoking, and this makes it much easier to get a non-smoking room.Credit must be given to the staff, who were very patient and did their best to help, right from the front desk (thank you Ms Ezy) to the technician (fantastic service staff - they arrived within 5 mins of me calling to ask for help to unlock the safe in the room). The hotel is indeed bustling with activity, and would not be the place for a quiet getaway, but it can't be beat for it's convenience and shopaholic fix, and it's value for money. Food wise, the cafe was basic, but having Dragon-i and Coffee Bean just outside makes up for it.One tip, if you are traveling for leisure upgrade to a Deluxe Room. The Superior room is small and cramped and is meant for Business travellers who just need a bed to sleep for the night. Also, if you can, try to get a high floor facing the KL tower. We didn't manage to get one this time, but with the haze, it was not much of a view anyway!!",4,Cititel Mid Valley

The views from the rooms have been very good.Importantly, I have never had a problem with soundproofing in this hotel so as long as it satisfied on this criteria, it remained a reasonable option.Having said that, the hotel is a 3-star property and there is no swimming pool or fitness centre available, should a guest require these things.The hotel location is a strong point. It's connected to the MidValley Megamall, which has all sorts of shopping available including many restaurants and eateries. The Gardens shopping mall is a little more upmarket but the foodcourt and restaurants at the Gardens are affordable and quite nice. The hotel is located quite near to KL Sentral and it's also located next to a train station but I understand that the trains can be infrequent at times. However, taxis are always available at the Midvalley mall.The rate I paid during my 4th stay, RM185 Nett per night, struck me as a little high. However, the hotel provides free parking for one car in a separate dedicated location within the parking area of the MidValley Megamall, where it can be extremely difficult to find a parking spot at times. So, if you are driving to the hotel or know someone available in KL with a car on hand, then it's a valuable service to have that parking spot.The hotel, in summary, is quite basic but presentable and comfortable.",4,Cititel Mid Valley

Rooms are spacious and clean. Staff is attentive. Though the lobby is always over crowded with guests (from hotel and from shopping mall). Perfect for business traveler. The location is a bit away from downtown. But if you don't go to downtown a lot this hotel is very convenient. Traffic is not so bad in this area. I don't stay in the room much and being next to 2 shopping malls is very handy for me.",4,Cititel Mid Valley

Bathroom is generally acceptable. Go to the other side of the shopping mall if you are taking a taxi, same taxi called from the hotel costs more than 2-3 times. If you are to shop and don't mind about the quality of stay, this hotel is value for money. Jet up a bit for Boulevard or Garden if you have the budget.",3,Cititel Mid Valley
Kuala Lumpur,Average no frills hotel!,Ulysseus,Delhi,2016/10/08 22:19:16,59200,Cititel Mid Valley Lingkaran Syed Putra,2009-03-09,Malaysia,I chose Cititel mid valley as I could not book the usual hotel I stayed in. The rooms were not very spacious..just enough leg room to move around. The amenities were ok...bathrooms could have been a little bigger though.Checking in took ages...there was a long line of people checking in and checking out.....there wasnt enough space at the reception to sit ....it was too crowded...The only plus point was that its bang right in the middle of a mall...so shopping is not far away..also its well connected by train to main Kuala-Lumpur so sight seeing is always on...restaurant was ok...nothing great.... I would stay here again only if I had no other options.,3,Cititel Mid Valley

The rest are malaysian&western food. The waiters and waitresses are very busy so it took them quite some time to take away your plate. They were quick for the 1st time and slow for the rest. An extra person not included has to pay RM35,which I would not recommend. It would be better to buy food from the food court at Mid Valley or The Gardens. Mid valley shopping mall is connected to the hotel,which is a thumbs up and the main reason I chose this hotel.The Gardens is also another shopping mall which is a street away from Mid Valley and also very close to the hotel. The staffs are friendly so it's another plus from me.",3,Cititel Mid Valley
Kuala Lumpur,"Convenient location, small room, not so competitive",tjakrabirawa,Indonesia,2016/10/08 22:19:16,59200,Cititel Mid Valley Lingkaran Syed Putra,2009-01-17,Malaysia,"I was going to KL on business trip and my counterpart there booked the accommodation for me. I believe it was much for the convenient location adjecent to the shopping mall.The location is good in the sense that you could find everything without needing to leave the location and deal with heavy traffic in Kuala Lumpur. Since it is connected to a shopping mall, grocery, drug store/dispensary, cafe and restaurants. Location was just fabulous.However, when getting back to the room; it is so contrary in convenience. The room was so small that the twin sharing beds was put almost sticking together. The space was so small that I and my colleague was like having problem in putting 2 luggages in that room. Shower will be a very big problem to a big guy due to its size. A big guy may not be able to turn around easily. Overall, I think this hotel is kinda expensive for that sort of facility. However, if you are staying only for a very short trip; this can be a convenient location to stay.",3,Cititel Mid Valley

Check-in was smooth, the front desk was helpful on sorting out the reservations and we didn't have any issues at all. The room I got was quite small but comfortable and I wasn't expecting much considering the price I got for the stay. The bathroom was a bit of a disappointment as I was expecting a tub to relax after travel but only got a shower with a cold floor with no rubber mats. At least the water heater worked without any hitches. The hotel is just beside 2 shopping malls so its pretty easy get anything you need. There is also plenty of food choices there so there is no need to eat at the hotel except the buffet breakfast which is mostly continental although they have some local choices and even for vegetarians. There was no foreign exchange in the hotel, so I went to the mall and looked for one and found 2 of them.What I really liked about this hotel is how accessible it is to the mall and to the MRT. Another nice thing is that its just a few minutes away from KL Sentral by cab so you can just take the KLIA Ekspres upon arrival and departure.",4,Cititel Mid Valley

The hotel room is really small and there was a persistent smell of cigarette smoke. It was as if the air-con vents out smoke and cold air at the same time! For those who are non-smokers and are sensitive to smoke, forget about this hotel. Room is dusty and far from clean. The bathroom was worse. The toilet floors looked like it has not been scrubbed for ages and it's so small that it's hard for an average size person to look straight into the mirror when brushing the teeth. They do not provide face towels and housekeeping standards are very poor including replenishment of toileteries etc. We do not recommend families or anyone on a holiday to stay in cititel. It is pretty doggy even though there's a fairly big shopping mall just next to the hotel. For those who are driving, be prepared not to get a parking lot in the hotel car park. It's really small too. But you can use the Mid valley mall carpark and pay RM5 per entry.",2,Cititel Mid Valley

I was rudely awoken past 12 midnight by someone trying to shove open my door. Luckily I had put on the security latch because that was the only thing keeping the door shut. The person had my ROOM KEY!Later reception called up. They told me someone wanted to deliver something to my room. At 12 midnight? Are they crazy? I told them I was not expecting a delivery. They then thought to check my name. Apparently someone else with a name close to mine (there were differences) had asked for the delivery. It still doesnt make sense. Dont reception call the room FIRST to confirm the delivery? How can they just hand out room keys like that?I thought it was bad enough that the place is accessible from a shopping mall & anyone can have access to the guest floors without a room card. Boulevard which is also adjoining the mall & run by the same management only allow people access to guest floors with a room card. Ofcourse apparently in Cititel it isnt that hard to get a room card.Dont stay here people! They seem to have overlooked the basic premise of security!If all this isnt enough to put you off the rooms are small cramped and smelly. Oooh. No go.,1,Cititel Mid Valley
Kuala Lumpur,Inexpensive but too small,Firebrezee,JB,2016/10/08 22:19:18,59200,Cititel Mid Valley Lingkaran Syed Putra,2008-02-18,Malaysia,"I stayed for about 5 days and 4 nights in the superior room. It is certainly very compact room. Since I stayed with hubby and 2 son (serve me right for not booking the deluxe room), it is quite cramp. Thankfully there's adjoining Mega Mall there so I bring my son everyday to that mall, if not... I think my son will drive me crazy. Btw, my hubby work until very late night so I am left with my sons. Food is ok... many choice over the buffet breakfast and its change everyday too. Lunch and dinner I went to the Mall where there's lots of restaurant and cafe. My advice is, if you wanna stay only for sleeping and shoping at the mall the hotel is for you coz the price is cheap (RM150) a night. But if you wanna a bit more comfort, maybe pay more at other hotel or take the bigger room.",3,Cititel Mid Valley
Kuala Lumpur,Hated it,h4ni,Malaysia,2016/10/08 22:19:18,59200,Cititel Mid Valley Lingkaran Syed Putra,2007-11-09,Malaysia,"I stayed here as I needed a hotel close to Bangsar and hated every minute of it. After getting to my room, I immediately regretted not paying a little bit extra and staying at Le Meridien (they had an off-season offer at the time--worth checking out), which is right on Sentral station and not that far off from Bangsar. The room was so tiny it made me feel claustrophobic. The furniture seemed new but VERY 3-star. Put it this way: a friend who was supposed to share the room with me declined and decided it was more worthwhile for her to travel to and fro from Subang Jaya (notorious for its traffic jams) than to stay in the cramped room with me!I love staying in hotels because I usually sleep better in them than at home, thanks to the blackout curtains (even though I have those at home as well, go figure!). The rude shock at Cititel: no blackout curtainson the tiny window, which, on top of it all, faced a roof! Busloads of tourists seemed to be hanging around the hotel lobby every day at check-in and check-out time, so it was always busy and noisy and not a good place for meeting up.A note about the location because this is what seems to be the biggest draw: Mid Valley is a huge mall with a large number of restaurants and shops. HOWEVER, there is no good time or right day to come here as roads are jammed up most of the time. The best way to get here is by public transport (either by Komuter or the lrt to Bangsar station and then taking the shuttle bus or taxi to Mid Valley) BUT as other reviewers have noted, this can get difficult during the rush hours.This hotel seems to be geared towards thrifty local/regional tourists who aren't very fussy. If you don't fall into this category, find another hotel.",1,Cititel Mid Valley

The furnishings also need some updating. The best part of this hotel was the breakfast buffet that was included with our room and it's location. It is in the huge Mega Mall that is a tourist attraction initself. I wish that we had more time in the mall, but we had come to see KL and didn't want to spend our time in a mall that looked like the malls at home. It was generally an okay hotel, but the rooms are cramped.",3,Cititel Mid Valley
Kuala Lumpur,Convenient Location,KeenTraveller21,London,2016/10/08 22:19:18,59200,Cititel Mid Valley Lingkaran Syed Putra,2007-10-04,Malaysia,Having used Trip Advisor to check out our hotel choices i find it only fair i give some feedback.Cititel is a pretty good hotel by Malaysian standards. The staff were very friendly (especially Marilyn the Guest Liason) on the whole and the location is amazing - right on the doorstep of the biggest shopping centre in Malaysia. We didnt eat at the hotel so cant comment - if you dont fancy eating at the hotel you can always make the 2 minutes walk to the food court of mid valley and have unlimited choice for whatever takes your fancy.The rooms are nice - nothing amazing. They are big and clean and the air con and fan make for a comfortable stay. Only complaint was the bathroom - perhaps a bit of updating required.The prices here are reasonable and it is also accessible as there are taxis on the doorstep. Though a word of warning - at least half of the taxis we hired didnt know where they were going - so make sure it is agreed the driver can be sure of the destination before you head off.Take Cititel at face value and you have a pretty good well run hotel perfect for short stays such as ours. We will stay there again when we next go to Malaysia.,4,Cititel Mid Valley
