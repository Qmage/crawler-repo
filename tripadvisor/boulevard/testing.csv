Kuala Lumpur,Mid Valley Expressway,The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,Malaysia,"I've stayed numerous times at their sister (and much cheaper) hotel, Cititel Mid Valley however for the higher price I paid at Boulevard, I was expecting a much nicer room. The carpets throughout the hotel was very old and stained. The carpet in my room wasn't that much better and was all crinkly. The general amenities and cleanliness of the hotel was fine and the location on top of a large shopping mall was very convenient. It is such a shame it is let down by the overall tired feeling - for a hotel that looks fairly busy you'd think they'd understand the value of a refresh every 5 years or so to keep the place looking in tiptop condition.I'd rather much save the extra money and stay at Cititel, at least then I could justify the price for staying in an older decor. Their customer service was very good so can't fault them on that.",2016/10/08 13:07:14,2016-10-04,Great location but dated looking decor,59200,jicby2,3,"Sydney, New South Wales, Australia"
Kuala Lumpur,Mid Valley Expressway,The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,Malaysia,"The hotel is an old 1980s Fit-out in desperate need of an update. The beds are hard, the furniture is old and very dated and the carpet is worn, faded, has iron burn marks on it and is very tired. The hotel car transfer I organized apparently broke down and they couldn't find a replacement. I ended up getting a taxi however they still tried to charge me and I was told I didn't show up! Then on departure the reception organized a car for 4am rather than 4pm. I was woken at 4am asking me why I hadn't checked out. Finally when I went to catch the car at 4pm I was greeted by a taxi, not a hire car!! I don't know why I paid extra for a cab that I could have simply got off the street. The entire experience was very disappointing.",2016/10/08 13:07:14,2016-10-01,Old and tired. Hotel transfers were terrible,59200,Frenchbd,2,"Sydney, Australia"
Kuala Lumpur,Mid Valley Expressway,The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,Malaysia,I stayed at this hotel when I came to KL for an IT training.Stayed at this hotel for 6 days.Overall this is a very nice hotel with friendly staff who looked in to guest needs well.Rooms were nice and spacious and I should give special recognition to house keeping team as they did a great job in room cleaning and service.I stayed with BB and breakfast were tasty and good in quality but unfortunately variation of food was very little and needs improvement.This hotel has a nice little pool and you can enjoy and relax.One thing I was disappointed was in-room WIFI which was not working from the day one.No signals at all and I informed to hotel staff but one guy came and checked and saidentire floor area(17th floor) seems to having an signal drop and will inform relevant division.But disappointing to say that it never got fixed :(.So management needs to check on this issue as it was a very trouble to me during the stay.This hotel is situated very near to the midvalley shopping mall and other shopping/business areas and train/bus services are also near.It will take around 45 mins drive to KL international airport.Overall I happy with my stay at this hotel.,2016/10/08 13:07:14,2016-09-26,Nice stay in KL,59200,PubuduA,4,"Negombo, Sri Lanka"
Kuala Lumpur,Mid Valley Expressway,The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,Malaysia,"I've been to boulevard several times in the last decade so we decided to stay there again when we went to visit. We ordered one of the executive suites as we were travelling with a child and needed another bed. The evecutive lounge (no children under 12) was nice and my wife enjoyed a nice breakfast while 3 year old and I had breakfast in the wild rice restaurant. The size of the room was good and easily fit another small single bed which is what we wanted. Also the fact it was so convenient to the mall was a huge bonus. The room was starting to become a bit tired tho, with large brown marks on the blue carpet in some spaces so its definitely due for renovations and the curtains had dark stains as well. Otherwise the facilities like the gym were relatively well maintained.",2016/10/08 13:07:14,2016-09-18,Nice but a bit old,59200,Alan T,3,

I can either killing or enjoy my times in the huge of shopping mall... in particular the chance to try a different local food every time without being worry of the prices :-)Always pick a smoking room for me so I don't need the ""Super Luxury with good view"" one. No big complaint for Internet connection, just send a silly request to hotel management to consider upgrading the room TV. well, while working to prepare the biz presentation in the late of night, both listening and watching my mp4 favo music via TV USB port seems could intensify my energy... :-)The food are not bad; feel good the breakfast at the smoking area near the pool.Enjoy the courtesy.",2016/10/08 13:07:15,2016-09-15,My 2nd times stayed in Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel Kuala Lumpur,59200,TonnisGinting,3,Singapore

Kuala Lumpur,Mid Valley Expressway,The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,Malaysia,"Was waiting for a short while waiting to be check in due to peak season - something pretty common. To our suprise to see that the management team had set their benchmark higher than our expectations when we saw this souvenirs as a token of apology due to the small hiccup earlier. Hotel was linked to the shopping malls with plenty of entertainment with wide variety of nearby rastaurants. We are certainly spoilt of choices. Definitely recommend if you are looking for a ""one-stop"" hotel with good service with self-sustained entertainment during your short vocation in KL.",2016/10/08 13:07:15,2016-09-12,"Friendly staff, great location, good service",59200,corsiva,5,"Singapore, Singapore"
Kuala Lumpur,Mid Valley Expressway,The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,Malaysia,"The Boulevard is a large business type hotel, adjoining the Mega Mall of KL. The reception area is very bright and marble, but the rooms are clean but no frills. Bottled water and free internet are provided. The beds are comfortable, but the rooms are poor for sound deadening. There is a good Gym and the pool is of a good size. Breakfasts are typical of far East hotels, with Western and local choices. Maintenance is suspect, and my first room had a flood through the ceiling on day 2. Getting a replacement room was difficult due to the intransigence of the staff, who were less than typical of most of my far East experience. I was first offered a twin room, and then an upgrade to the 28th floor, at a cost. I pointed out the problem was of the hotels making, and they eventually relented on the cost! The upgraded room was identical to the previous one, but had a chocolate bar and a couple of fruit drinks. It did allow access to the executive lounge which was very good, with complimentary snacks / drinks in the early evening. There is a railway station nearby for KL, but the service is at best 2 an hour. Overall, fit for purpose.",2016/10/08 13:07:15,2016-09-11,A reasonable business hotel,59200,crawfie,3,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom"
Kuala Lumpur,Mid Valley Expressway,The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,Malaysia,"We've chosen this hotel time n time again, mainly for its location location location. Eat, shop and eat some more in relative safety. Noted some good changes.  Wifi is really good even in the rooms. Booster (or what appears to be) in room means no more glitchy knock-u-off wifi flow. I was elated!  Comfortable, clean rooms and great views if u get high floor. Non smoking my choice, I can breathe  not enough electric sources. Found one under my bedside table. Almost twisted my back to get to it, gave up.  Great checkin person. Great smile n very welcoming.  Could use better toilet paper, like the one we had in Sri Lankan Heritage chain, Kandulama and Tea Factory, Nuwara Eliya. Best TP in the world.

Kuala Lumpur,Mid Valley Expressway,The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,Malaysia,"Where do I begin? For starters, my request for 2 non-smoking rooms was not met. I was subsequently ""upgraded"" to a deluxe room on a smoking floor. I was also assured that the room would be refreshed before hand. The room reeked of stale smoke despite being ""refreshed"" (which consisted of someone giving a few cursory sprays of air freshener). Upon unlocking the door, I could hardly open the room door as the carpet in the room was so badly creased, it blocked the door from opening properly. On top of this, the carpet was horribly stained through out. Things soon went from bad to worse when I decided to have a shower and found that despite cranking the hot water all the way up, all I got was a slightly better than ice cold flow. Lastly, the shower fittings were damaged where they emerged from the tiled wall. As I was staying there for two nights, I had requested a change of room for the second nights stay and was assured that a non-smoking room had been reserved. Needless to say, when I went to change the room the following day, I was told that the rooms were no longer available. Having conveyed this and more to the check-out lady, I was assured that I would be hearing from the hotel management. Again, I have not received any communication to date and this is why I have decided to leave this review.Please stay away from this well below 3 star establishment!",2016/10/08 13:07:17,2016-08-11,"I couldn't give minus stars, so 1 will have to do",59200,Devi1ishUk,1,UK
Kuala Lumpur,Mid Valley Expressway,The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,Malaysia,I booked a room through Agoda. When I checked in the hotel gave me a smoking room. I asked for a switch and they declined because they said if I did not indicate to Agoda that I need a non smoking room (there was no such option on Agoda's website) by default I will be given a smoking room and they cannot change it.So for all those who make bookings through third party websites or to this hotel please REMEMBER TO INDICATE SMOKING OR NON SMOKING.,2016/10/08 13:07:17,2016-08-11,Terrible Hotel,59200,884chins,1,Singapore
Kuala Lumpur,Mid Valley Expressway,The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,Malaysia,"We had booked for 2 non-smoking rooms and upon arrival, they mentioned the only ones available were smoking rooms. As we were staying two nights, we asked to be moved to non-smoking rooms on the second night and had been told they would be reserved. And despite this, they still failed to secure non-smoking rooms for us and gave it to others. Such incompetence. They offered to refresh the room which amounts to spraying some febreeze into the air which does next to nothing when smoke has permeated every furnishing, cloth, airway, and the entire corridor outside. The offered to upgrade us to premium rooms in the smoking section. Premium comes with carpets that looked like they either caught fire or was stained really badly; followed by a bathtub with creepy yellow stains.

The chauffeur made a mistake by dropping us off at The Gardens-St. Giles Hotel (the hotels are under same management and a stone throw from each other). The staff at The Gardens informed we were at the wrong hotel. Our MPV has left. And we have our luggages.The counter staff smiled and said, ""No worries. Our porter will help bring you to The Boulevard"". A pleasant 5-minute walk and we were warmly welcomed at The Boulevard. The staff was pleasant and warm. Check-in was fast without any fuss.The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. My room has a river view. Room was bright yet not glaring.

Kuala Lumpur,Mid Valley Expressway,The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,Malaysia,"I visited St Giles on recommendation of a family member who stayed there before. The hotel itself is in a beautiful location set in the middle of Bangsar, and on top of a mega mall. It is also adjacent to the Garden Mall - everything of which is accessible without the need of going out of the premises.The proximity of all the shops, restaurants is just a shoppers dream!The service was ok. I can't rate it 5* because of some complications at the reservations desk - the staff seemed unsure or confused about what to do with us, a family of 6 including 2 children. They wanted to upgrade 1 room and downgrade another which we though unfair since we paid a decent amount for each room per night, After much haggling and waiting, we finally got a room - nearly 2 hours after check in, and considering we were late on arrival in the first place - it should not have been the case.As for departure, they were not even considerate enough to allow us extra time of 2 hours (due to the disservice on check in, and the delay) as our flight was in the evening.The room service and laundry services were quite good. Efficient, and quick.The breakfast dining area located on the 9th floor, was ok. Nothing to write home about - in fact the selection at our previous Hotel, was much better. However - it wasn't bad or anything. I guess we were impressed with a larger selection at our previous location, and for which we paid much less, than the somewhat minimalistic selection at The Boulevard.The room was tastefully decorated, and the bathroom/shower area was pleasant! The Wi-Fi wasn't all that great.I would probably opt to stay at St Giles The Gardens next time, and because of the fact that our family loves the mall, cafe and restaurant scenery, The Boulevard could be our second choice.
