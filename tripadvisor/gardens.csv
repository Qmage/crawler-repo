Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,ReginaldSLin,"Stayed there for 3 days while attending a meeting in the same complex. The check in was smooth and professional. Room, a one-bedroom apartment, was really nice. The bedroom was huge, with 2 wardrobes, so that 2 people could each have their own wardrobe. The bed was really comfortable, and there was even a couch in the bedroom. Bathroom was spacious too, with the toilet separate from the shower and bath - a nice touch which I always like.The living room had couch and 2 armchairs and long coffee table. A writing desk was in the corner. Huge TV. Kitchenette fully equipped, with counter and bar stool.It was perfect. Made it home away from home for me.Sure some of the wood surfaces showed some wearing, but that is to be expected - at least it's real wood, that's why it wears, not plastic.",Great Apartment Hotel,Lingkaran Syed Putra,5,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Singapore, Singapore",2016-10-06,59200,2016-10-08 22:19

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,shuffyzz,"We stayed overnight for an event nearby the hotel. Check in process was smooth and breezy, the lobby is huge. Concierge guy being helpful with our luggage. Love the room, decent size for the price. And they have rain shower along with bath tub! We ordered in-room dining at 11.30pm, the girl over the phone said the food will be ready in 40 mnts. But surprisingly it came knocking on our door after 15 mnts! The nasi goreng kampung was delicious but mee goreng mamak is a turn down. We had our breakfast pretty late (10.15am) and they already started packing stuff and not refilling the drinks and some food already finished. Nevertheless, the spread was amazing, delicious and great. I love the people at the egg counter and roti canai counter. Very attentive and helpful.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Sailortraveller,"Was staying in this hotel from 20 Sept to 23 September and got room 916. Was in KL on business and discussion so most of the time we were based at the lobby bar near the hotel reception. It was a convenient location to meet and the atmosphere is conducive for the discussion that we were having. Staff was attentive but severe shortage of manpower. There was only one service staff on duty and he was handling everything. I love the room especially the bathroom. This is the first time I encountered a rain shower,a bath tub and a hand shower in one bath room. The bath room layout was great, it segregated the toilet from the shower. There is a toilet room and a shower room and you have draw out drawers for hair dryer and to put towels. Bath room accessories are elegant and really user friendly. It a really well thought out and designed for the traveller toilet especially for the female traveller. Well the hotel have link bridge is connected to the garden mall and the garden mall has link bridges on the basement, 2nd and 3rd floor to megamall. A lot of restaurants on the basement level and you have 2 anchor tenants Aeon and metro with many other shops on all the 4 levels. The sports equipment and accessories shops are all located on the highest level and you even has a cinema with 21 screens! Couldnt ask for more. Too bad we only has time after work to explore the area. We didn't even need to venture out during the 2.5 days that we were there. Great place to stay, shop and relax By the way the gym is huge, too bad I don't have time to use it.",Comfortable stay with great personal touch,Lingkaran Syed Putra,4,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Singapore, Singapore",2016-09-24,59200,2016-10-08 22:19

I had some serious arthritic back problems addressed while on business and staying at the hotel. A bandage leaked and blood stained my sheets. Sabrina realized and saw that I was unable to walk.. She immediately made up my room, helped me, got me water, advised me that she would be working on the floor and that I should call if I needed help. Sabrina notified her manager, Marina who soon visited me, saw that I could barely get out of bed due to back & hip pain. She asked what she could do to help and brought in Suzana . Margaret also was notified and visited. As a traveler for over 20 years, there is nothing worse than being sick on the road. This team supported me, provided meals, water and a late check out.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,HXZ_HZX,"Booked a deluxe room at the hotel via their website and it was seriously good valued for money. Corporate photos looked luxurious but I was somewhat skeptical based on the price. It turned out I was right. It wasn't as luxurious as what you see on their website.So pay for what you get. With that in mind, one would get good value for a stay here. The room was clean, modern but somewhat basic (eg no hot water kettle for coffee). The state of the room was excellent except for the bathtub. Everything looked renovated but the bathtub. Strange omission.The establishment could be classified as a family or budget business hotel. It was not within international hotel chain standards. But that would cost at least 1.5-2x more. The lobby was basis. There was a lounge available for business. But you could got to the malls for alternatives. On malls, this hotel was connected to a high end and mass market malls.

Check-in was a breeze at 6pm, with the process done in a couple of minutes. Since the hotel is connected to a big mall, dinner choices are practically meters away from the hotel. (The best part is you need not worry about having a little too much to drink because, worst case, you can crawl your way back.)The deluxe room I occupied had the following basic and special features: large LCD TV, king-sized bed, plenty of pillows, walk-in closet inside the toilet and bath, and nice view of the city. Furnishings were alright. Very convenient place. Room cleanliness can be improved though as I noticed a small piece of trash, cotton buds and dirt by one side of the room near the curtains.

We booked our room through Booking.com. Rate was RM407 er night p(excluding GST). Arrived and passed our car to valet service (it's RM20 per 24hr for Hotel guest). Check-in to our room at Level 23. We got the pool view. The room was spacious. Lots of compartment to store your stuffs. Bathroom was spacious too. The best part staying here? The access to the mall of course. The access to the mall is to the left of the hotel reception counter. You will find the Robinsons department store exactly next to the hotel-mall access. The security system is good whereby only hotel guest can enter the hotel lobby via card access between 10pm to 10am daily.,Outstanding Location for Shopping Addicts!,Lingkaran Syed Putra,4,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",2016-06-28,59200,2016-10-08 22:19

And if you're not from this region and arrived after 10 pm and driving, forget about trying to enter the lobby upon parking. Double whammy! Buzzer doesn't work and you'll be stuck outside by the mall area. We stayed here in March 2016, we highlighted these challenges to the manager on duty then, sad to say, three months after, nothing has changed. We were hoping the hotel management would've taken steps to rectify these basic challenges. How disappointing. Needless to say, return to stay no more.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,krace168,"The first thing you need to know about the two bedroom apartment at the Gardens Residences (not the hotel) - before you book it - is that the beds in the ""twin"" room are single beds. They are not really meant to be for two people. It's a slightly oversized single bed. That room is also very small.The other room is a decent size with a King sized bed with room for a rollaway bed, which we did ask for. Once said bed is put in there, the room becomes very tight.There aren't a lot of well situated power outlets for charging your phone. I had to unplug the bedside lamp to charge my phone near me. There is one multi-plug outlet to accommodate any kind of plug but that's about it. There was one that I used to charge my tablet in the closet (the one for the iron).The kitchenette is very convenient and while we didn't use the stove, we made full use of the microwave, toaster oven and fridge. The overhead fan didn't work and it didn't bother us enough to ask them to fix it.Bathrooms are en suite and very nice. Watch for the slightly different level of floor between main section (sink) and the shower/tub.Otherwise, everything seemed convenient. There is even a way to exit to the mall without going outside, from the 6th floor, by the restaurant - Sage. All this is very nice for shopping and coming back to the room. The Residences side seems very spare - the lobby is modest and occupancy seems low. The hallways are warm, but that shouldn't bother you much.",2 bedroom apartment near Mid Valley Mall,Lingkaran Syed Putra,4,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Saint Louis, Missouri",2016-06-15,59200,2016-10-08 22:19

Each unit complete with kitchenete, ironing facilities, comfortable bed and spacious bathroom.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,pt2pt3,"Some colleagues told me this hotel was very Holiday Inn like and not nice. Well the Gardens St Giles hotel exceed my expectations. It's for sure has all the 5 star feels, yet I would never rank it with Shangrila or Mandarin Oriental. Slow vehicle drop off process as the path is busy with vehicles. But its not too far from the Sentral Station in case you want to save time with the express train from airport. Get a taxi at Sentral Station by booking at the desk inside near exit. Outside you get the thuggish operators charging fixed higher rates. I don't mind paying but it's the bullying that I dislike. Hotel lobby is simple and connects easily to Gardens Mall which connects to Mid Valley Mall. So too many shops and too many eateries. And cinemas too.Rooms are spacious. I think we had the renovated rooms. This would explain some of the precious reviews about outdated. The bathroom is huge with separate toilet door. Bed is huge. Too firm for me. Nicely built up room with good light controls at bedside. Nice views. Room service menu was wide range and 24hrs on all items. Amazing cos even the best hotels cut down their options after 11pm. Gym was very spreadout with views. Most spacious I've ever seen. Room cleaning carries on till late. Rest of facilities I did not try. Overall the stay exceeded my expectations.

I then decided to use the bathroom and lifted the cover of the toilet, to be greeted by a seat covered in urine. In a freshly cleaned room, at what I can only describe as the most ineptly managed hotel I have had the misfortune to stay at in recent times.From there, it's just about going through the motions: arrival of duty manager, change of room, granting of an upgrade, arrival in new room, which of course looks exactly like the previous one, [new] checking of the toilet seat (some old stains on the seat, nothing new, so deemed acceptable) and departure of manager.Basically, if mediocrity and ineptitude decided to launch a hotel together theyd come to the St Giles Gardens in Mid-Valley and consider this an unbeatable blueprint.

Since we need two rooms and the place offers a two bedroom apartment, this looks great.Check in and out: Swift and quickRoom: Clean and comes with a small open kitchen. Simple appliances such as kettle, oven, refrigerator, are available. Too bad, washing machine is not available. Looking at the room set up and carpet, the room looks old and worn out.Wifi: free but very slow. Took me a long time to update an app on my phone. YouTube seems not streamable.Car park: Biggest disappointment. The concierge told me to drive to the basement and look for yellow pillar. I found a lot of yellow pillars but empty parking lots are not available. I parked in the purple zone far away from the hotel after driving around for 20 minutes. I also found out that parking is not free and I will have to pay RM5 per entry. Not that it is super expensive but I have not paid multiple times per day in my recollection of hotel stays. This is a first for me. Now, this is not the end. If you want to leave the car park before 10a.m., you only have one option and that is to drive out through the Bangsar exit. Hence, if you are intending to get to PJ, KL, or the airport, make sure you are prepared to first go to Bangsar and route from there.Breakfast on Spread: Great service, great varieties, great food. I ordered a fresh carrot and found that it was mixed with water. A lot of water and the glass turned out very flat. Coffee was mild and bland.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Mohd Ivan H,"Gardens Hotel definitely offers more spaciousness in their rooms compared with Boulevard and Cititel in MidValley. At a bit more in price, it is definitely worth it. Access wise, it is better for pick-ups and drop-offs, as there is an extra lane for short waits. Exiting the hotel lobby into the Gardens Mall gives you shorter distances to better eating outlets such as Italiannies, Alexis, and Japanese/Korean restaurants up the first escalator from the hotel's exit to the mall. The hotel is more generous with extended check out times, and you feel relatively less rushed that the other hotels in MidValley. Definitely the classier part of MidValley to stay in.",More luxury of space,Lingkaran Syed Putra,4,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Kuching, Malaysia",2016-03-30,59200,2016-10-08 22:19

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Jennifer K,"My initial impression of the hotel was much worse than my final opinion at checkout. When I arrived at 2:00 pm after an early morning of travel in the intense KL humidity my room wasn't ready. The lobby was a little dated and the guy at the check in desk didn't speak English that well. After leaving my bags in a friend's room and going to a meeting, I returned to get checked in to my own room. It was uphill from there. The room was fairly large and pretty comfortable. The wifi worked well. The breakfast buffet was so so... Better some days than others. The location is good, though. The hotel is attached to a large mall which was very convenient.

Hotel rooms' decors and furnitues had certainly aged quite a bit. Perhaps this hotel could do with some renovations in the very near future. We booked two deluxe rooms during this short 2 nights visit. Cleanliness was fair in the bedrooms. But in one of the rooms, we could constantly see a few crawling ants on the bathrooms countertop. Which we had never encountered during our previous many visits. The mug was not clean!!We did not try their breakfast during this visit. Check in and check out were fine.The only reason to stay in this hotel would be of their good location. This is the most expensive of the three hotels that attached to the Mid Valley/Gardens shopping malls. Hence it is certainly not cheap at all. One could practically shop till you drop. Plenty of shops and eateries.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,KC_Boon,"We stayed at this hotel from 27/2 till 29/2 to attend a friends' wedding. I read the reviews from TripAdvisor before booking this hotel and we're glad to have chosen this hotel for our stay at KL this time. We arrived around 2pm and had a little trouble to find the lobby from Mid Valley car park (we parked at Zone B level P3). Check in was a breeze and fast (less than 5 minutes) although we had to wait 10-15 minutes to get our room due to high occupancy that weekend. (Apparently there was a BMW Tennis Open on going). Front Desk service was excellent and friendly. Room wise, it looked bright, modern, clean and relatively spacious, I believe it is meant to cater business travellers as well besides the holiday travellers. Bathroom was also spacious and bright with big mirror. One thing I noticed, there was a lot of drawers in the room, perhaps to cater for long term staying guests. We had some problems with the room fridge and a call to front desk quickly sent a maintenance guy to fix/ replace the faulty one. I would say the hotel acted fast to guest's response even after office hours.Our stay was without breakfast option so I have nothing to comment. Because the hotel is within the Mid Valley shopping mall, food selection is not an issue and there are plenty of choices to choose from either on Level 3 or Lower Ground. Hotel guests can park their cars at RM5 flat rate per entry (must be validated at Concierge) although I would wish to have complimentary car park for hotel guests. I was told car park management is not part of hotel but that should not be an excuse for not providing a complimentary car park. Guests can park at either Zone B or Zone U. If you park at Zone you near Robinsons, there are elevators which can take you straight to Hotel Lobby at Ground floor. Parking at Zone B requires you to pass through shopping mall.Overall, we had a great experience staying at this hotel and looking forward to coming back in our next trip to KL.",Clean & spacious room in high accessible location,Lingkaran Syed Putra,5,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Portland, Oregon",2016-03-03,59200,2016-10-08 22:19

I had a bad experience today when I checked in. I presented my confirmation number to the trainee at the counter, but yet he ignored me and informed that he is searching the system for my booking based on the name shown on my identity card. I have to emphasize many times to him that I did not book using my name on my identity card. He took his own sweet time asking for my details and started keying in to the system. I have to chase him, as it was taking too long. Finally, he tossed me my key card and gave me my wifi log in details. It was already 2pm and I had 4 meetings until 9pm on the same day. Unfortunately, despite many attempts, I was unable to log in to the Internet, thus causing conveniences.At 1am, I called the duty manager for help with the hotel wifi. I was shocked to find out that the reason I couldn't log in was because my name was keyed in wrongly. The check in counter keyed in my name without any spacing between each words!What unreasonable mistake? !!Thus, if you are only interested in the rooms and environment, Gardens is a good hotel.

After we booked, found that there are some bad comments regarding their stay here. The only downside of this hotel is the parking. Having hard time finding parking since hotel and malls are sharing parking areas. Especially when u stay during Holiday season or weekends. we were staying in Deluxe room @ 20th floor and it's spacious and comfy. We have no issues finding food, the only problem is that too many choices for u choose frm The Garden or Mid Valley Mega Mall. However , there is not much view from our room. U can see St Giles Residence right in front and few construction sites around. anyway, we chose to stay away from crowds in KL city so we stayed here. What surprised us was, they had fireworks show at the rooftop car park and it was rigt in front our room. who would have known that we get to enjoy watching fireworks from our room. We don't know if it's from the hotel management or the malls. we don't really care as it came when we least expected.

No bellboy available so save on the tips, lucky we can handle our luggage well. 4 lifts available with very fast availability, access card is needed for entering the hotel lobby door from 10pm-6am, which is added security especially in Malaysia.Am very pleasant with the spacious living room with an equipped kitchen - toaster, oven, microwave oven, dish cleaner, sponge n all kitchen utensils. Bedroom is very spacious with one sofa bed which can be opened up for additional pax. TVs are small but it doesn't matter cause we don't stay in the room to watch tv. Separate bathroom with bathtub & shower facility from toilet, nice design for a very spacious bathroom. Another good point is the super strong water supply that can easily fill up the large bathtub within 2 mins and fast draining system too. Other perks include balcony with 2 chairs n a coffee table, laundry drying shelve, ironing board, iron, hair dryer without the need of requesting, just readily in the room upon entering. Nice and accommodating housekeeping ladies too.Location is nice especially when it's connecting to the gardens shopping mall and mid valley mega mall, easy to get food everywhere and shopping is just there, robinsons, isetan, metro and etc.. Cold storage at basement of the gardens and aeon supermarket at basement of mid valley mega mall. 3 days 2 nights trip was just at this area and there's no need to go elsewhere.One setback is the cleanliness of the room, which needs lotsa improvement I think, sofas are full of stains, carpet felt dirty and balcony seems very dirty all around especially the handrail.",A nice stay overall,Lingkaran Syed Putra,3,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Singapore, Singapore",2016-01-04,59200,2016-10-08 22:19

Unless you are specifically going to the mid valley mall for the weekend this is not a travel friendly place. You have to cab everywhere and the traffic is always terrible. At least 30 rm to get to the center in the day time. 2) the beds are quite average the bathrooms and amenities the same. In a city we amazingly affordable premium hotels why stay at this place that is average. 3) old school silliness. If you don't turn in your key card they charge you 40 rm. are we serious here. I turned mine in so no big deal but seriously if they are that hard up for cash I can find about a million old key cards they can reuse. It's just cheap ridiculousness.

Only to realize when we arrived that we would be housed separately as the apartments (read: residences block) were different from the hotel rooms (read: hotel block), so we upgraded to the 1-bedroom apartments so that the entire family of 6 could reside together. Sorry for the excess detail; thought some of you in a similar situation might want to know. The residences are a tad more expensive as they come with a full kitchenette which we hardly bothered with considering the array of food in the Gardens Mall and at Mid-Valley. You would be spoilt for choice: our family's faves included Tim Wan Ho dim sum, the Village Roast Duck and Madam Kuan's. On the whole, if your aim is a shopping-and-eating getaway as was ours (we have seen enough of splendid KL on prior trips), then the Gardens is well-placed. No cabs necessary at all as the upmarket Gardens Mall and mid-range Mid-Valley Megamall are a stone's throw away by foot.

She proceeded to check me out until I realised that I had left the deposit envelope on the tv table in my room, she beckoned to concierge, Hod. Very efficiently, he went upstairs and got the envelope for me while I was signing out. In the meantime, Fanny helped me charge a limo taxi from Swift to my room at a flat rate of RM$150 to KLIA. If you pay cash, then it is by meter. That was a good idea as I realised that there was a long and winding traffic jam of cars heading both in and out from Mid-Valley.

In the course of my day I need to go in and out 4-5. If I use the valet parking, it would be 20 per entry which is ludicrous for an in house guest. Parking could easily balloon to 100 ringgit/day.The internet booking engine is archaic in that if you request for a King sized bed room, room and bed allocation is left to the whims of the front desk personnel. They allocate whatever they have available at the moment and would rather a room go empty then to try to accommodate the guest and win some goodwill and repeat business. In fact the front desk personnel attempted an upsell when I was checking in.So be warned, what you book may not be what you get. Also the rooms are cluttered and obviously have seen some better days in the past and would be in need of a refurbishment soon.Nevertheless, to be fair, if shopping is your thing and you do not really need to drive in and out, plus proximity to a mall is an important consideration, then the location couldn't be better. Just that the feeling I get from this hotel is that they are trying to nickel and dime everything.There are better options elsewhere.",Do not stay here if you need to drive in and out,Lingkaran Syed Putra,1,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,Hong Kong,2015-10-20,59200,2016-10-08 22:19

Staff is friendly and very pleasant.-Rooms are big and spacious and generally modern.-OK views on the higher floors-Wifi was good and stable-Prices seem average-This hotel is right next to the Gardens shopping mall. A lot of stores and restaurants in here. Likely to get anything you will need including luxury stores.-Breakfast was included in my room rate but a pretty good selection. Wish the food temperature was a bit hotter for the hot meals.-There are nice surprises sometimes - the last trip I came back and there was a tray of fresh fruit and chocolates left in the room. A nice treat. -Seems very safe - need to scan your room key to use the lifts. -If you're someone who loves to look at exotic cars - well there are always a list parked out front. Lambo, Ferrari, GT-R, Rolls, wish they would let me drive one. Things I wished they did better:-I felt the rooms could be serviced a bit better as my room felt a bit dusty. -Also as I had many conference calls, the room has 2 phones but none of them had a speaker phone which is a real drag when you have 5 hours of calls. -My Iron did not work.-The ceiling light fixture opened after the first day and for the next 3 days no one even fixed it.

When you press 'Clean my room' late in the afternoon, nothing will happen.We stayed there for 3 nights. The 2nd and 3rd night, we found our bath towel were not clean - one with terrible smell (like hadn't been used for long time) and the other one with a few marks (blood or something else) which is very very disgusting. I can't image it happened to a 5 star hotel.The last night, I ring the front desk to book a taxi 6:30AM for the next day. I was asked whether I wish to pay by meter or charge back to my room (which will be $150 as they charge for return as well). I chose to pay by meter and was told taxi will be booked. However the next morning, no taxi came! Front desk said there was no such booking and asked whom I spoke to (I don't remember at all!). Then they apologized and tried to book another taxi for me. This time, they ask me whether I want to book cheap taxi ($100) or the hotel taxi($150). I told the lady this was not I was asked, I insist to pay by meter and booked a cheap taxi.A few minutes later, a taxi came. Front desk said to me 'This is not a hotel taxi, we are not responsible for the driver and you need to pay full responsibility for everything'. When door man opened the taxi door, he also said something in Malay to the driver. Both of us smelled something but we had no choice as we had a plan to catch.When we took taxi from airport to hotel, it was $70+ on meter but this time, $199!!! After the last toll charge station, meter increased from $60+ to $199 in a few seconds!!!I refused to pay for $215 and argued with the driver. Then the driver made a phone call (spoke in Malay) which I strongly suspect he was calling the hotel front desk. After that, he told me, they say pay $100! (who are 'they'???)It was very shocking. That $100 paid off my taxi fee as well as the St Giles The Gardens - Grand Residences.

So in terms of shopping, this is the ideal hotel. Staff is friendly and hotel is representative of a 5-star hotel. However there is heavy construction right across the hotel and there isn't much of a view from your window.Another thing I'm not very happy about is how the hotel treated me on the day of check-out. A letter was placed OUTSIDE my door to inform me that I'm due to check-out today and that I should call the receptionist if I wish to extend my stay. That is fair enough. But I don't know why the letter has to be placed OUTSIDE my door and not slipped inside my room under the door? Wouldn't security and privacy be compromised?

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Greg N,I always worry about a hotel that starts barking out rules and telling you of additional charges and fees the moment you hit reception.If your key card is not returned on check out there is a fee - and they make you sign for it. I happen to think the hotel is just as responsible to remind me to return it at checkout time.Hotels like this want to pass all the risk (and their responsibility) onto the guest - although in this hotel you really don't feel like a guest - just an inconvenience.The facilities are fine and the rooms present well and have all the mod-cons you would expect from a 4 star hotel.My room had a damp/stale air smell which cleared after running the air for a while.For breakfast I like a single fried egg over easy on a single slice of toast. I asked for the egg to be cooked at the Buffett and was handed a precook one that clearly had been sitting for some time. I asked for a fresh one and the chef (who was standing in a group of 4 chatting) refused and said the one I had was fine. Rather than argue - I had cereal.Some big hotels project an enthusiastic or high energy atmosphere that adds to the experience - this one struggled to raise a yawn.Attached to a huge shopping centre is probably an advantage to some but also attracts lots of traffic going shopping which makes entry and exit by car a nightmare.,Could be really good - however .....,Lingkaran Syed Putra,3,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Booker Bay, Australia",2015-09-08,59200,2016-10-08 22:20

I watched them from my table, and sure enough, she put the clay pot back on display after 5 minutes. I can't say for sure that it's the same pot, but I'm sure odds are it is. I'm disappointed with my stay this time around.","Great location, comfortable - BUT..",Lingkaran Syed Putra,3,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Singapore, Singapore",2015-08-17,59200,2016-10-08 22:20

But the manager did a great service recovery buy offering us free dinner at the hotel restaurant, while we waited for our room.The room was huge, with a fully functional kitchen, with everything you need for a family and baby. The mattresses were just the right firmness, with a soft pillow and a firm support pillow - which ensured we all slept very well - many hotels have mattress that are too soft with not enough support.The location is perfect - there is the Gardens mall and Midvalley Megamall within 2-3minutes walk. All the different varieties of food and retail are available. There is a ncie variety of good breakfast places such as Tim Ho Wan and White Coffee and ANtipodean cafe.If you feel the need to venture out, Bangsar is a 5min drive away.

My room was on 16th floor and the view from window was amazing. Kuala Lumpur skyline including side view of Petronas Towers were visible from the window. Since I am Indian Vegetarian there were few options for me in the breakfast. I would urge hotel to keep good options for vegetarian food and also to keep them separate from non-veg food. I saw people using same spoons for taking veg and non-veg food. Wi-fi is good and the room is large and adequately furnished. No. of channels available on television are quite few. The blue cab available outside hotel are quite expensive. Use ""MyTexsi"" app to use cheap and affordable cab in KL.KL Sentral station is nearby to the hotel. Mid Valley Mall and Garden Mall are adjacent to the hotel. Variety of shopping options are available here. My flight back to India was on Saturday @ 08:20 pm. Hotel did not agree for late check-out (at 4 pm) though rooms were available. They asked for additional 50% of the room rate for 4 hour extension.

As expected, had a follow-up meeting in Mid-Valley and took the opportunity to come back to this hotel (seemingly out of misplaced curiosity), which, on my previous visit, delivered a totally disastrous stay (see the link below or through my profile).On this occasion, nothing unusual happened, which gave me ample time to experience how truly average this property is - anywhere else, a mid-range 3 stars hotel at best.From the check-in, impersonal and perfunctory (with a timid ""welcome back"" showing that somehow a customer management system is operational) to the complete lack of in-room welcome amenities (one would have imagined that after the disaster stay, a nice letter and a couple of token items may have been warranted - not so) to the dubious levels of cleanliness.Tap water comes with a strong earthy smell and yellow hue, executive lounge has a very bland and unappetizing selection and the staff there seems equal-parts bored and uninterested. In the lounge, I asked for a paper cup to take away a coffee and this proved way too much for the staff there who could not locate this rarest of items...

It is very convenient from the airport via KLIA express + KTM Commuteer (just one stop away from KL Sentral). The location is top notch if you're there for business, specifically around the Boulevard offices etc. However, if you're in Kuala Lumpur for touristic purposes, the you might as well pick hotels around KLCC, Bukit Bintang area. That is what I did in my first trip to KL, and since this was a business trip, it worked out great for me.The signage to the hotel was a little bit missing. Especially when I was walking through the Mid Valley mall, I couldn't see any signage for this hotel. And once after I found the Gardens mall, then I was able to figure it out. The hotel is nice, clean. My room was on a very high floor, overlooking the Petronas tower and downtown KL. But the windows definitely needed a clean up. Lots of dirt showing on my pictures of Petronas. The room, the bed, carpet etc. all looked very new and nice. The office chair was very high end and comfortable. The bathroom was the best part of the room. There is both a soaking tub and a shower area, as well as a separate toilet area. In room, there is complimentary water and iron/ironing board, bathrobe etc. all in good shape. Wifi was pretty good. My rate included buffet breakfast. There was a lot of selections, however, if you have western tastes, then many of those options go away.

Front office staff seem to have very little discretion and lack empowerment. They were rather disorganised too. The hotel rooms and public areas are showing signs of a lack maintenance (that's different from aging). If that wasn't bad enough, I was accused and charged MYR10 for a broken tumbler!!!!!!! Which 5-Star hotel in this day and age would charge their guest for such a small damage and at such a huge mark-up??!! I am quite sure that tumbler would have costed them less than MYR1 each!

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,janey_bei,"I was surprised with the accommodation I had in The Gardens Hotel- St. Giles in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia. This hotel is located in like one of the business districts in Malaysia with a mall beneath the hotel and office towers on the other side. I had a quick check-in coming from almost an hour ride from the KL International Airport.I was pleasantly surprised with the room I got. Maybe because I saw one of the rooms in St. Giles in Makati, I must say the room I got in The Gardens deserved all the stars it could get. It was very clean, the bathroom was huge and there was like a dresser area right outside the bathroom which was separated by a wall towards bedroom. The pillows were just right for me. Having a free welcome drinks from the bar was also something I appreciated. It was not just water but sodas to choose from. I honestly did not get to drink all of it but was happy to have choices available and best of all its free. The room was very comfortable and it has all the features anyone traveling in business would ask for. The hotel is connected with malls so doing some side shopping will help you save time especially when it can actually get a little busy going out of this area during busy hours. The is a cold storage supermarket at the basement in one of the malls and I had easy time buying some Malaysian coffee and chocolates that I could bring back home. Access to various restaurant choices was also something to be happy about the location of this hotel. The breakfast at The Spread was also superb. There was a good spread of asian, western and even halal breakfast. I specifically enjoyed the Malaysian rice cakes. I am such a rice cake fan and the Malaysia ones were similar to the ones I enjoyed back home with the Malaysian touch. It has the right amount of sweetness. In terms of hotel staff service, there was nothing extra ordinary about it but I still find their staff helpful and responsive. When you ask for something they would surely attend to your needs. Checking out was also a breeze. It was indeed a hassle free stay.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,gridskipper,"The Gardens Hotel was a perfect stay for my first trip to Malaysia. To paraphrase Maria Bamford, there is something reassuring about a corporate chain when you're feeling out of place. There were no moments of delight during my stay, but I welcomed the comfort of such predictable competence.Although I chose a smaller room, it was more than adequate. I really like the convention in Southeast Asia of having a separate bathing area with a bath and shower. There was an enormous desk and several shelves to spread out on, as well as a mini-fridge. Most impressive was the lighting -- I think this might have been the best lit hotel room I've experienced in years. (Oddly, the area around the sink was the only exception.)The room was wonderfully quiet. Wi-fi was free but the speed varied wildly, from 30 kbit/s to almost 3000. Room service was superb. The windows did not open, but I've come to expect this in a high-rise building. And although I was aided by the exchange rate, everything seemed very reasonably priced.The one fault I would call attention to was the surprising amount of damage to the room. There were scuffs on the wall, one of the drawers insisted in staying open, the drain in the bath was damaged but working, and the shower head was in desperate need of descaling. (As in, water was shooting in every direction.)

We took the one bedroom premier which has a large separate sitting room with an open plan kitchen. Perfect if you are travelling with kids.The hotel is interconnected to Midvalley Megamall shopping complex which is the main reason we stayed here. Its a very convenient shopping complex in KL which almost has everything you need. We looked around to see if there was any other good hotel which was interconnected to a big mall which had one or two bedroom suites/serviced apartments but couldnt find one which made us feel comfortable.Would I return here? Yes, if am coming to KL I wouldnt stay anywhere else.

The extra space and convenience was definitely worth the money we paid as there was a promotion at the time of booking. Rooms were clean and all the toiletries were replenished on a daily basis. The apartment was directly above the Gardens Mall which meant we had access to the mall and the adjacent Midvalley mall as well. We practically did our shopping within the two malls only as most mid range to high end brands were available there.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,KT785,"This is the most expensive of the 3 hotels at the same location. The others are the Boulevard and Citytel. You get the same shoping mall, same convenience, but pay the highest price for this hotel, so it is supposed to have superior service, It doesn't. There is an opulent lobby where taxis drop you off, but it only has the concierge and bell service. The reception is further in, and quite plain. The other entrance is through the shopping mall, and an important business guest who was to meet me at the executive lounge had a confusing and unpleasant experience. There is no one, not even a door man, to guide guests at this entrance. As the reception had a long queue and he needed directions, he stepped into the restaurant that overlooks the reception and asked how to get to the executive lounge. The bartender was very curt, and used very rough language, never showing any courtesy, e.g. ""what do you want?"" ""are you a guest or an outsider?"" ""listen to me"". My guest was told he needs to queue up with guests waiting to check in/out as he cannot access the 29th floor without being swiped in (it didn't even matter that this guest was in a bespoke, Saville Row, suit). Only when he protested that cannot wait in a 5 deep queue just to go up for our meeting for which he was already a little late, he was directed to the concierge at the lobby, who brought him to the lifts and pointed out there is no card access at the lifts and that he may go straight up and that the receptionist at the lounge will attend to him, which he did. Our business meeting started very badly, and I almost lost my deal. The moral of the story - save yourself some money and stay at the other two hotels, where expectations would be lower, and staff less pompous, and less likely to be condescending. Many of the reviews talk about convenience, location, etc, and there is nothing to really differentiate between the 3 hotels. If you want luxury, there are many more, bigger brand name hotels quite close by, where they tend to address guests politely.","1 of 3 hotels at location, but average",Lingkaran Syed Putra,3,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,KL,2015-05-20,59200,2016-10-08 22:20

They even have a self-service laundry area on the 17th floor. Staying here was a perfect choice esp with kids in tow. The location is also hard to beat, with two shopping malls just at your doorstep and a supermarket for your convenience. Easy to get taxis if you wish to make a trip down to KL (Gardens is not in the city centre, fyi. It's about 20-25 mins away by taxi, during off-peak hours).

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,DrGiGiEvil,"Before reaching the hotel lobby, we had to go through a notoriously heavy traffic jam along the Federal Highway, leading to Mid Valley/Gardens Shopping Complex. We took almost 30 minutes to find a parking spot!! There was no designated parking area for hotel guests, meaning that you need to compete with the never-ending mall-goer crowd.Nevertheless, I like the hotel. Nice bathroom with a bath tub. Comfortable bed. Room interior was tastefully designed. Swimming pool was decent. There was a 1.2 metre deep adult pool and a small kiddie pool with no lifeguard on duty. The gym was spacious and well-equipped.Room service and breakfast buffet food was delicious. However, may I suggest to the hotel management to please provide the ordinary coffee/tea- either at the buffet counter or table-served. They were only 2 coffee machines in the cafe for guests. We had to queue quite long for the coffee! Mid Valley and Gardens shopping malls, attached to the hotel were amazing- there were little kiosks selling cheap little stuff to high end designer boutiques- the malls are for everyone! You can find a variety of food selection at these malls at affordable prices. There were 2 cinemas- Golden Screen cinema offering standard and gold class experience in Mid Valley, and the premier-level Signature Gardens cinema at the Gardens. My advise is: Please buy your movie tickets online!! The hotel offers free high-speed wifi. So don't waste your time queuing up for the movie tickets- the queue can be very long, especially during weekends.In my opinion, if you are looking for a place to relax and do some shopping/ movie watching, this is a great choice. If you plan to do some sightseeing or travelling around KL, maybe it's best to take the cab from the hotel (I'm sure the receptionist can arrange this for you). Otherwise, you would have to persevere driving through the traffic jam, and compete for the parking spot again!","Great for shopping; problems with parking, traffic congestion and breakfast buffet coffee!",Lingkaran Syed Putra,4,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,,2015-05-13,59200,2016-10-08 22:20

Also, the hotel is attached to two large shopping malls (one very up market, the other more average shops), there are many restaurants available here and shops are open till late (10pm).Would recommend the executive upgrade, the lounge at the 29th floor is good, continual supply of nibbles during the day and free happy hour in the evenings.

The room is of decent size, modern, no fuss but the smell at the foyer is rather intense and unpleasant, although the room is fine. The WIFI is good and there's no complaint on this front. The concierge and bell boy clearly need to prioritise and appreciate that when people are in a rush, they must learn to act quick rather than taking their time to retrieve luggage. The front desk people don't seem to have a clear idea of the locality.

So for those who are not fluent in Bahasa Malaysia, may find this very interesting as a kickstart to stay in this hotel. We were given a card to our room. The card is needed to access the lift. So, i must say this is a good safety system. Then we went to our room. However, as we reached the 13th floor, we could smell unpleasant odour. The smell was pretty nasty. Perhaps it came from the carpet. Then, we entered our room. I must say the design was quite fresh. I love the bathroom so much. The design was very ideal for a person like me who really loves modern interior design. The room was spacious and clean. In fact, the bathroom was pretty amazing which full of mirrors. We had a really great time. The most crucial thing is the hotel is next to the shopping mall. Easy to get delicious food, shopping. However, I would like to advise you about the foods.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,NoOnesHome2day,"The location was the primary reason I chose this hotel. There are no arguments on that except if you have some friends in Kl, they could argue the location is the worst ever as for them to come and pick/meet you up at mid would require extensive efforts and time through the jam. This is especially true when there are Aeon sales and other promotions going on in both the malls. As this was my first time stay here, I was expecting being the most expensive of the three available options (the others being cititel and boulevard which I've stayed in previously), that this hotel should have excellent service and amenities to offer. Firstly, I, myself and my luggages were attended to very well by the Bell service staffs whom were all very sincere and smiley. But the service experience did not continue through at the reception as I felt less welcome and acknowledged. My observations were thar the receptionists somewhat seemed unenergetic and unhappy in their jobs eventhough they tried to put forth a smile.Secondly, I was given a room that smelt of cigarettes after a long haul flight at just before midnight. Then, they got me to wait for their call for at least fifteen minutes at the smelly room which in my opinion could be done within a shorter time period. On the plus side, when I got to my less stinky but not exactly odorless free room, I settled. The room size is definitely for the claustrophobic me. Very spacious with wasteful compartments almost like it was for a longer term stay such as pull out drawers beside the bedside cabinet with a walkin ensuite bathroom. I particularly liked how the bath and shower room was separate and also isolated from a toilet room. I also liked how there's ample spaces for luggage to go on which was excellent for the heavy-traveller I am.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,apactraveller,"Let me be clear  there is no possible reason why anyone would want to stay in this hotel other than having to visit a client based in the mid-Valley complex and who insists on booking you thereFor all other purposes, this property is a total disaster, managed by what can only be described as casual hobbyists of the hotel industry.Check-in was oddly slow, with a guy trying to push aside his female colleague (to look at my credit card or check-in details?) to the point where she had to physical push him back and away  uncomfortable to watch as I was sorting out the usual paperwork I confirmed the room would be without connecting door (a pet peeve) as requested  was told this was the case only to find one upon arriving.I requested to change room (***room change #1*** big mistake) and was promptly settled in a second one. Overall, very dirty room  stains and impossible to identify substances on some of the furniture, broken drawers, rubbish left in a cupboard and some food debris strewn around the seating area not nice.Water has a rather unsettling green hue (in all rooms I occupied, so this is due to the location/filtering)  hard to capture in picture but very visible in person In-room dining is mediocre at best: canteen-type food displayed as such.In the morning, upon leaving, I casually checked that the door was indeed locked behind me to my surprise, it opened without the need to use the keycard Assuming I had blocked a latch I tried several variations only to realize that the lock was actually broken  I had slept with the door unlocked I immediately called the duty manager and asked to change room. He indeed managed this but not without wasting time by going back down to reception instead of using the rooms phone to fetch a key (***room change #2***). I dropped my roller and left, late for a meeting.I returned at around 10pm and noticed the faint sound of water dripping  the room looked fine so I didnt investigate further. In the morning, the entire false ceiling above the entrance had a very dark tone  a small hole had water flowing continuously from it  clearly a pipe or air con duct had broken, with water pooling in the ceiling under it broke throughAgain, I called the duty manager (same guy), who arrived with an air of slight disbelief instead of getting a key sent from reception he, again, left to go there directly. I was eventually fetched by one of the bellboys who took me down to reception there the hapless manager was being shouted at by a very irate guest who had herself experienced a litany of service issues in the short few hours since she had checked-in Once she had finished haranguing him, he invited me to walk over to the Residence area to get my fourth room (***room change #3***) again, late for a meeting by then, I dropped my bag in what looked with a rather spartanly furnished two-bedroom serviced apartment  no folding suitcase rack and no working desk other than a small one facing the wall clearly yet another downgrade in comfort.Upon returning at night I found a bottle of wine and a cake with a note of apology  all very nice aside from the fact that the wine was displayed alongside a glass which had clearly never been washed (layers of red wine crusted the bottom of the glass) and the cake with plate and knife/fork with food deposits on themFinally surprise upon going to bed, finding that one of the pillows had dry blood stains on it (see picture) Overall, this property is absolutely terribly managed  incredibly poor if not dangerously incompetent maintenance, awful housekeeping and very bad food quality.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Little_Bird2003,"Stayed at the Gardens Hotel for a staycation recently. The hotels sits atop the Gardens Mall. As it was my first time to the hotel, it was quite difficult for me and my wife to find the hotel parking. Ended up parking at the mall, which charged the same rate although it also means that we had to walk quite a bit.Upon check-in, we were asked to sign a form to declare that we would be charged RM30 if we loose the key card. I usually keep a key card as a souvenir so I found this quite peculiar. I was told that this was because the hotel used 'German technology'. Honestly I didn't find it any different from key cards used in other hotels.The hotel itself is very nice with good minimalist furnishing. I particularly like the gym which is very big and airy. The fact that it is attached to a mall means that you can easily eat out if you don't want to eat in the hotel which we did. In any case, the main restaurant was undergoing renovation so breakfast was served in a makeshift cafe in the ballroom. It was most distressing without any ambience and the spread was not so good either.One pitiful thing of hotels in Malaysia in general is that while they were built grandly with great property and beautiful furnishing, after only a few years you can already see their deterioration. This is exactly what I felt during my stay at the Gardens. It is just sad to see a property that has great potential decays slowly into an average hotel. The management should pay more attention to details to improve the hotel. One particular example is to ensure that the housekeeping do their job properly. I found some mouldy spots in my bathroom for example.Despite that I still give the hotel favourable rating because of its location and also great property in general. I really hope that the management can address some of the problems to prevent its further decay.",Great potential if handled properly,Lingkaran Syed Putra,4,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",2015-03-28,59200,2016-10-08 22:20

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Hokey78,"This hotel has all the trappings of a 5 star but feels like much less. We arrived at 1pm, about an hour before the check in time. I didn't expect to be able to check in, but wish to add that at most hotels it has never been a problem. Despite the fact that we had a toddler with us, the counter staff simply sent us away and told us to come back later to collect our keys. I would have at least expected them to make SOME effort either to keep us comfortable for the hour or to see what they could do about an early check in. In the meantime, our bags (which were supposed to have been given to the bell boys for safekeeping) were left in the lobby unsupervised in full view of everyone.The rooms are pleasant enough but unremarkable. Every room door along the corridor slammed, which meant that we were constantly being disturbed. We also had trouble getting our rooms cleaned. If you leave your room from 10am to 2:30pm, it should get cleaned. A further appointment for cleaning was also missed.Breakfast is abysmal. Selection and food quality were way below par for a hotel of this standard. On the plus side, service at the restaurant was the best service we got for the entire stay.The location is reasonably good if you are there for the mall. Otherwise, bear in mind that Midvalley is relatively isolated from the rest of KL, with limited public transport options.Overall, this place is acceptable only if you get a good deal, but certainly not at anything close to their rack rates.",A 3 star hotel masquerading as a 5 star hotel,Lingkaran Syed Putra,3,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,Singapore,2015-03-03,59200,2016-10-08 22:20

Why I only gave this place a 3 out of 5? Well, despite being the best of the 3 hotels here, the room we stayed in was very dated. The carpet had strange stains all over the place. The bathroom sink had dark stains on it and never came off even after our 3 night stay. The flush for the toilet is falling off so that you can see the hole in the wall. The swivel mirror in the bathroom looks like it was coming of its hinges. When you see these sort of things in your room, then you start to worry about whether the sheets are clean, were the glasses washed, etc. Certainly we felt a little uncomfortable.

Staff are very professional from the reception to the bell boy. Security is paramount and even the lift is key controlled.The locale is wonderful in the midst of a great shopping and wonderful restaurants. The mall caters for the high to the lower end or local fare. Restaurants range from the ritzy to the ""must have"" nonya food and cakes. Need just a cuppa tea, you can go to the local Toast Box or the TWG concession for tea in Chinaware, pinky up!One does not need to move from the locale provided one can find a good parking spot. I recommend once you got it ..... just stay. Parking is only RM5 per exit with endorsement from your hotel. Problem is the parking may be a nightmare if you arrive during the local feeding times. The Boulevard Hotel has better access parking than the Gardens. Parking is shared with the Mall. Only one word can describe the parking, it's HAVOC! Besides that, one can probably never see all the Mall has to offer, from its Gym, pet shops, Daiso, spas, hairdressers, Robinsons, Isetan, Cold Storage and many cute cart concessions that sell everything from mobile phone covers to durian puffs. All the ""junk food' shops are there too as well as Apple, Aeon and the list goes on and on.At night there is some night entertainment, although I can't speak of it as the day shopping was so tiring so we hit the hay after a sumptuous dinner with friends.

I'd love to give this hotel a 5-star rating, because I really like everything about it from their well-appointed rooms to their attentive housekeepers, doormen, and concierge staff. Their biggest problem is that the front desk staff (or perhaps it's the front desk system) never gets my information right. I am such a frequent visitor that their doormen know me by name but the front desk staff / system recognizes me as a 'mister' when I'm clearly a 'miss' despite having requested the front desk staff to change that info a week ago when I last stayed. I simply can't emphasize enough how important front desk staff / systems are in ensuring an overall positive experience for guests. I do not particularly enjoy filling up a form with my name and other particulars every time I'm visiting. That's the last thing any business traveler would ever dream of doing, let alone each and every time! When asked, the front desk team also seem to be unable to articulate the current promotions advertised all around the hotel lobby but their bell man fully well knew what I was asking after and referred me to the f&b outlet. At this rate, the hotel would probably be better off replacing the front desk team with some self check-in terminals.

The hotel is directly connected to the mall so easy for me to grab a quick bite or get a takeaway if I need to work in the hotel at night.In addition, the hotel provides a pretty good breakfast buffet selection, which was a welcome start to my dreary mornings in KL.

Promise to upgrade to a suite. The room given 2625 was not a suit and smaller than room no 809. Faiv insisted it was a suite, I asked him to have a look, he did not want to and ask me to stay in that room and promised to upgrade next day. Next day, Faiv said need to check with manager. Never got back to me until the last day of our stay and gave us RM 100 voucher (this was not communicated to the staff taking over his shift - made me like a fool) and given a room to move. I said to the receptionist Riviera that I will have a look first if it is worth moving just for another night. She did not responded to me and called the bell boy to assist me to move room. Asked to see a manager in the evening manager did not come and attendedmy concern because too busy reading emails. I cannot wait around for the duty manager. The receptionist Sid that duty manager will come and see me in my room????? Not appropriate. Duty manager never got back to me. I can not be bothered anymore.

They were still talking loudly and slamming doors at 2 am. I call the operator and after 20 minutes noise level were lower. Thanks to the security.Another thing is that if the hotel is unable to cater their breakfast for all guest they should not take that many bookings. I had to wait in the queue for breakfast.

The hotel is pretty quite for its reputation of which I like. No busy traffic compared to the Boulevard Hotel even at the peak hours. The parking lot at the basement is very nice and convenience as it provides access directly to the entry door of the hotel.The Concierge is a mix bag of dedication. Those from the Eastern part of Malaysia specifically from Sabah is providing excellent service with an effort beyond their requirement. However, the same does not apply to those from the other parts of Malaysia. One or two might charge you with providing boxes (a throw away commercial boxes) that should have been free.The direct connection to the highway is also a plus for those who are driving. This means that traffic jam can be reduced significantly.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Linda L,"A hotel that boasts high-end everything - from room rates to brands in its mall below, The Gardens. Sorely over-rated by all standards. Rooms are small and very basic, breakfast at the all-day dining outlet The Spread was so disappointing that I decided not to even have my breakfast there by the 2nd day. The minibar refrigerator was empty and the bathroom amenities were typical mass produced 3-star type standard items. Worst of all is parking! Finding a lot is an absolute nightmare as the adjacent Mid Valley Megamall is a popular shopping destination for locals and carparks are a shared facility. Warning : Leave your car and take the local train or taxi service if you must leave the hotel. You don't want to spend over an hour just to look for parking space only to end up parking a whole inconvenient distance away from the hotel lobby! By the way, the beds are on wooden frames so no divan, which was quite dated if you ask me. Well, at least they had a pillow menu to choose from. Overall, not a good choice for family-stay. Ok if you have the cash to spare for an over-priced convenience, especially if shopping was your main agenda. But I would have rather spent the money on the shopping instead and choose to stay at other more affordable properties also adjacent to the malls - there's Boulevard and Cititel, both cheaper and couldn't be much worse.",Over-rated property,Lingkaran Syed Putra,3,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,,2014-12-12,59200,2016-10-08 22:20

In addition I book the room only for myself and also gave her my passport and confirmed my name verbally when asked. She then commented I will be sharing a room. After the clarifications, it took me another 20 minutes and going up and down twice before I finally get a room.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Ellie_PikeUK,This hotel had a spacious room with great breakfast included (wide variety and large dining hall). It was ideally located for my business trip although probably not ideal for tourists. The attached malls (one high end & one slightly cheaper) had a huge variety of restaurants which made eating out in the evening safe and easy. The hotel is a little dated and bathroom could have done with some mould removal and plug hole unplugging (feet bath in shower!) but overall a safe and pleasant stay.I would recommend to single women on business trips to stay within the mall complex at night and not to venture in the surrounding area alone.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Brian N,"I stayed here for 2 separate weeks in September. The hotel is at an excellent location, connected to big malls. Given the notorious taxis in KL, this is something important to consider. But that's all, nothing else is up to standard.When I checked in for the first week for room 2103, I saw some stain on the carpet and a small cockroach in the bathroom. I thought that was not too bad and did not tell the staff about this. However, when I was there for the second week at room 2017, I found that the toilet seat was not cleaned and obviously there were urine stains. I called housekeeping and somebody showed up more than half an hour later. The person applied some detergent to the toilet bowl and flushed the toilet. That was all he did before trying to leave. He didn't even take a look at the toilet seat. It was hard to communicate as he barely spoke any English. I ended up washing the toilet by myself. In the following morning, I saw a much bigger cockroach touring my toothbrush and other stuff. I called the reception about the toilet and the cockroach and requested to move to another room.It took them an hour to find another room 1816. The reason was that they had to inspect the bathroom and the toilet to make sure that won't happen again. Unfortunately, when I had a look at the toilet, I saw the same thing, urine stains on the toilet seat. And there were also ants marching in the bathroom and also on the cupboard near the TV.I believe the entire housekeeping was not well trained given that 3 out of the 3 rooms were not cleaned properly. Not to mention the slow response of most staff, very slow check-out by the trainee without supervision, very low-quality breakfast (although good spread)...My recommendation: look for another hotel managed by one of the international chains",Terrible housekeeping,Lingkaran Syed Putra,2,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,Hong Kong,2014-10-09,59200,2016-10-08 22:20

The sliding door to the bathroom was very sticky and was a pain to open and shut each time. Also the toilet wouldn't stop running a couple of times and had to depress the flush button to make it stop.Strange also that the wake up call was followed up 5 minutes later with a reminder call - is this the equivalent of a snooze button? Problem was that after wake up call, I was in the bathroom and had to rush out to realise it was a 'reminder call'. Perhaps if the guest answers the phone at the original wake up call, they don't need a reminder call?We appreciated the dressing gowns in the room and that it had an iron and ironing board handy. 2 complimentary bottles of water given.

As it happens, the receptionist I spoke to on Sat (7 Dec) hardly registered the fact that my children were with me.- for breakfast, the scrambled egg pot wasn't labeled and it was closed; this meant I was standing there needlessly for 8 minutes or so. I mentioned this to the person clearing my plates, he merely grinned at me (at Novotel Beijing, the scrambled eggs container is very visible so everybody knows immediatley what's inside); note: small things like this matter, don't they? I suspect you know- the boiler plug in my room (1118) was loose (give it a few weeks in its present condition and a short-circuit or total disrepair may result); the fridge door also gets easily 'stuck' (and as a result when I first opened it I discovered it was ALREADY open and there was water inside - obviously the ice melt or something?)- no one was manning the Pool towel counter around 4pm on Sat- I didn't receive a reply for my email dated Dec 7; why not? surely you don't think it's good practice to ignore what your customers - who pay north of RM460 a night - say?",There are better alternatives at this kind of price,Lingkaran Syed Putra,3,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",2014-10-03,59200,2016-10-08 22:20

Housekeeping was very accommodating with our requests for extra blankets and softer pillows. Babysitter (Riza) during our meeting was very patient with our kids (they can be a handful), so thank you very much! :) Location-wise it is great!!! As we were mainly there for a meeting, time constraints meant little time to shop. With The Gardens Mall and the Megamall right next door, food and a bit of window shopping is not a problem! :) Now, my only gripe is with the taxi (and very likely the doorman) that was called to the hotel during check-out. Now, we were in a hurry to get to the airport but while waiting for a taxi, there were a few blue taxis which came to the hotel but was told to 'go' by the hotel's doorman. Then one came, we loaded everything into the taxi and was a few feet away when the taxi driver told us it is a standard flat rate of RM$150 from TGHR to the airport. We insisted on using the meter, he said no..that it is hotel policy. It was only when we said to drop us off back at the hotel and we confirm with them that he relented and said to use the meter, but he have to go back and let the hotel doorman know.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,daedream,"In August 2014, I stayed at both the Hotel and Residences sections of The Gardens for 5 nights in total. Due to a booking hiccup by my company's travel agency, I was placed in a 2-bedroom apartment at the Residences for my first night. It features a master bedroom with a king-sized bed (which I stayed in) and a smaller bedroom with twin beds. Both had ensuite bathrooms. A largish living room with a balcony and an attached kitchen would, I imagine, allow for entertaining a group of 8 to 10 people comfortably, though I was cautioned by the concierge against throwing parties (I was solo, so she probably thought I was expecting guests). The decor was comfortable in a cosy chalet style, though the wallpaper was peeling at sections due the tropical humidity. One point to note, the refrigerator made a strange sound - like a man breathing heavily. It was extremely creepy to hear, especially as I checked in near midnight and it was the first thing I heard as I opened the door to a darkened room. I checked with the porter who immediately identified the refrigerator as the source and explained that it made the noise as it was empty. I switched it off for the rest of my stay! I moved to the Hotel from the second night on, and it was (of course) a much more reasonable size for one person. Comfortably decorated, it was in all ways an acceptable business hotel - though the wallpaper was again dismally peeling here in large chunks. I had room service at both the Hotel and Residences, and service was prompt and the food delicious. WIFI connection was also consistent in both sections. One thing to note is that the rooms are all non-smoking. Smoking is only allowed at the apartment balcony of the Residences. The best part of my stay was definitely the location within Mid Valley City. Both the Hotel and Residences are linked to the Gardens Mall - which features upmarket boutiques like Louis Vuitton and Gucci. The basement food district has an array of local and international dining options, and it also links to the Mid Valley Megamall just across the road - which features more of mass market brands like Muji and Mango. The entire complex - comprising the Hotel and Residences and both malls - was completely surrounded by ongoing construction, when I was there. Noise wasn't a problem as the construction was a distance away, but there is nowhere else to get to by foot. If you would like to visit the central side of Kuala Lumpur (e.g. Bukit Bintang), it would be about a 15 to 30 minute taxi ride away depending on traffic conditions. Bangsar, touted to be a ""bohemian"" enclave with loads of watering holes, is about 5 minutes away by taxi.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Adelyn K,"I requested for room change upon checking-in in the afternoon. After settling down at the new room, I left the hotel room after taking shower. I got back to the hotel at night. To my horror, I heard noises from inside the room when I was at the doorstep of my room. I rang the door bell for a few times and decided to open the door with my key card. I saw a housekeeping staff inside my room, charging a tablet/smartphone at the bed table. She told me that she was cleaning the room because the room had been checked-out. I told her that's not possible because I've just checked-in in the afternoon. She then showed me a list with my room number listed as 'DIRTY'. She asked me to bring along my luggage to the front desk and check with the staff there. She stood there and did nothing. I had no choice but to go down with my luggage. I found out later that the front desk didn't update the systems when they changed my room in the afternoon. The systems was still showing my previous room number. After some 5-10minutes of rearrangements, I went up again with my luggage to another new room. The whole experience was awful! When I re-think about the whole incident, I felt terrible. I was given a 'DIRTY' room which the previous hotel guest had just checked-out few hours before! And, I took shower and used a towel that probably USED by other people! This is really terrible and totally unacceptable!!!One more thing, I somehow felt lucky that I left the room with my luggage locked in the afternoon. I am quite doubtful that my belongings will be safe if I've left my luggage unlocked. Beside that, I don't feel that I'm being treated as a hotel guest when I was being asked to bring down my luggage and check with the staff downstairs MYSELF!! Is this the correct way you treat your hotel guests? Excuse me, you claim yourself as luxury hotel. I felt like I was staying at a budget hotel! When there's dispute, the hotel staff could easily get help from a supervisor or a manager or contact the correct person for assistance. I don't think it is the right way of settling the problem by asking your hotel guest to look for help by themselves! Besides, the front desk staff were not well-trained. Other than messing up with the room changing, they didn't even tell me where's the lift to the rooms, where can I get my breakfast (I've paid for that and they knew about it too), etc. these are part of the standard duty of the front desk, don't they? Or, you actually expect your hotel guests to know inside out of your hotel? To add, I seriously have doubts about the cleanliness of your hotel. I had skin rashes after staying at your hotel and I'm still on medication now. Also, please check the room facilities too. The cover of the room door knob dropped when I open the door. All in all, the overall experience.. I don't feel like I was staying in a luxury hotel (as what you claimed to be - a luxury hotel), not even a minute. It was way below my expectation. I felt like I was staying at a budget hotel, seriously. Probably a budget hotel could provide better service. I'm very doubtful if I will book this hotel for my future trips or even recommend it to my friends or family. I received no apology, not even an acknowledgement of the problem from any of your staff during and after my stay. I've given this feedback through your hotel survey last night.

Yes, the hotel is a bit removed from the main shopping belt of Bukit Bintang/KLCC but both those areas are just a short cab ride away. The malls at the hotel tough have more than enough shops to occupy me for a few days. For a 5* hotel, their rates are also fairly reasonable. Service standards are quite high with very friendly staff.The Could-Be -Better - The rooms. While nicely designed and clean, they appear a bit tired. Could do with a bit of sprucing up. Also, even the most expensive rooms are rather small. They have no real suites. If you want a living area, you need to book one of their residences which is actually designed for families. The breakfast is also underwhelming. Its just too hectic and at times too dirty to be considered enjoyable. Very functional feel. The variety and quality of food is also very run of the mill.

The staff on the front desk barely speak English, which is alright if at least she gets the basics right, but even basic difference between Mr. and Ms. seems to be really challenging for her.At ""The Spread"" (breakfast restaurant), there are two staff checking whether your name is on the list but no one send you to your table and ensure that coffee is served (which is the standard of every other hotel around the world). I went for breakfast at 9am, there were no clean table. When i asked for cutlery (as there were none on the table), the staff conveniently forgot to attend to my request.

Not great location if you like to walk to places instead of taking a taxi (although taxi's are very inexpensive) because there's nothing but construction around at the time we stayed. The best thing about this hotel was the Executive Lounge. They serve a hot breakfast, mid afternoon snacks and a 2 hr complementary happy hour and are located on the 29th floor which afforded us with a breathtaking view of KL. This worked perfectly for us as we were working and it was not only convenient but also tasted great.

Chose this hotel over hotels in Bukit Bintang as it's located next to 2 malls--The Gardens Mall and the Midvalley Mall. Spoilt for choice on dining options.Stayed at the executive room with club lounge access. The club lounge is quiet and serves coffee/tea/soft drinks all day along, and evening cocktails from 530-730pm. Room is spacious with nice big bathroom with rainforest shower and bath-tub. Hotel bell-desk not very friendly and trying to dissuade us to take normal taxis, and kept urging us to take their hotel 'limo' taxis.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,tutz_valle,"Ive stayed at the Gardens Hotel once, and at the Residences at least twice over the past six months. If it werent for the location, I would have chosen some other hotel. I say this for several reasons, the primary one of which is the lack of hygiene and sanitation in the food and beverage outlets. I would always have to check the plates and other tableware at the buffet line to ensure I get the clean ones. Oftentimes, I spot some crumbs or food particles as it seems these are not so thoroughly washed. On two occasions, I had spotted chefs hold the bread with their bare hands (the irony is that there are even plastic gloves or tongs for guests to use when they get bread from the basket). I avoided eating bread after observing this, especially after seeing one chef scratch his nose, then handle the bread with the same hand he used for this purpose. I thought that if they could do these kinds of actions right within the view of the guests, what more when they are in the kitchen with no outsiders to observe them. The Housekeeping staff should be supervised more. I believe they know their duties but are just not that meticulous when it comes to cleanliness of the rooms. I inspect counter tops after each time that my room is made up, but often find thick dust in many areas. Many times over I have noticed food trays in the hallways left uncollected for more than half a day, sometimes even overnight.If this place is really a luxury hotel, I am sorry to say that my expectations were not meet. On the several times that I had stayed at the Gardens, I did not feel pampered at all; it was more like the staff that I had encountered gave me an impression that I was a burden to them. None of the housekeeping staff smile nor greet when they come to deliver/pick up the laundry, even if I do so as I open the door when they knock. In fact all of those whom I have encountered had a pout on their faces, making me feel as if I had asked too much for them to have to come up to our floor. The ladies at the reception likewise are stiff and cold. They always appear to be busy and seem not to have time for us guests. Even the staff at the Executive Lounge have the same demeanor; it is very seldom that they smile and greet when I enter the lounge, and seem to be always busy with their computers and other paperwork.Much about the condition of the facilities have been mentioned in other reviews, and I can only say that I totally agree that there really is a need to upgrade and renovate if this hotel is to continue with its claim of being a luxury hotel. I would have preferred for these comments to have been expressed in a guest feedback form for appropriate action by hotel management. However, it appears the Gardens does not actively solicit guest feedback as I have not seen any forms made easily available for guests to fill out.I do hope action be taken on the feedback I have given, and that I get to see visible results in the event I get to stay again at the Gardens.",DISAPPOINTED GUEST,Lingkaran Syed Putra,3,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",2014-07-18,59200,2016-10-08 22:20

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Steve D,"My wife, 17 year old son and I are staying at the Garden Residence in a two bedroom serviced apartment for one month. This is an incredibly convenient location!! Take the elevator from your 30 plus story high room overlooking KL, down to the Gardens Mall or the attached Mid Valley Megamall to enjoy well over two hundred eating establishments from very inexpensive local food (my favorite) to high end Western style restaurants and everything in between. There are supermarkets should you decide to prepare some meals in your room, shopping from the top brands e.g. Gucci, Versace, LV etc. department stores and plenty of local shops? Two great, especially comfortable movie theaters are within the malls as is a fairly high end fitness club, Celebrity fitness. Fortunately we have been able to obtain a short term fitness club membership to help keep the weight in check. Taxis are easy to find and the KTM line to the Sentral Station is connected to the mall.Our two bedroom premium apartment is very large and extremely comfortable. In fact, the beds and sheets (I believe changed every day) are so comfortable we sleep even better here than at our home in the U.S.. We may look to purchase a similar style mattress when we return to the U.S. There is a pillow menu which included very high quality feather pillows. Apartment has three flat screen TVs two very nice bathrooms with rainfall showers and a large living and dining area with a balcony overlooking the city (but not the KL towers). The kitchen is reasonably well equipped,well enough for us to host a family dinner for 8-10. There is a very nice, under utilized infinity pool with cabana style covered lounge chairs, and the pol water temperature is just right and the pool is large enough for lap swimming, I would guess about 20 meters.The staff here are incredibly friendly, responsive and helpful, from the bellman at the lobby to the front desk staff, housekeeping and engineering. We had a couple of minor problems with our room during our stay which were responded to immediately by the staff, including follow-up to ensure that everything was resolved to our satisfaction.Bottom line, we could not be happier with our choice of the Gardens Residence for our extended stay in KL. One thing I would suggest is adding a few extra television channels, though they show Bloomberg, I miss my CNBC!","Location, Comfort & Service",Lingkaran Syed Putra,5,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,,2014-07-17,59200,2016-10-08 22:20

Compared to the one bedroom suite we usually have at the Traders the rooms at the Garden Residence are bigger and cheaper. They come with a balcony and a fully equipped kitchen. They are cleans and comfortable.The team at the front desk is very friendly and helpful. On our last day they gave us a late check-out at 3pm without extra charge. The transfer to the Airport was twice the usual rate but provided in a regular taxi (clean and big though) which of course makes no sense to book since there are plenty of taxis outside due to the mall next door or arriving guests.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Pavel B,"This hotel was pitched on hotels combined .com as a five star. I think that they should review this. I am not sure, on what planet this gulag would qualify as a five star. From the arrival I began to raise an eyebrow. The tiles on the pillars in the Porte cocher are falling off, the chandeliers are broken. In the bedroom the pillow smelled of feet. The safe did not close. In the bathroom there was a flourishing growth of fungi. The faucets had reverse treads. The swimming pool water was not clear. I did notice a person taking a water sample while I was there. However, it did not get is soup-like clarity in one day, so I wonder what was the purpose of taking a sample if he was not going to take any action to correct the condition or close the pool. There was fluorescent green fungus on the floor of the swimming pool shower. The pool was unattended for the duration of my visit, despite the presence of poolside menus. The railings at the pool were rusty, with paint flaking off. The sun-lounger mattresses are mildewed. In the all-day -dining restaurant, the closets and shelving were scuffed and cracking (not well constructed to begin with) the trolley had been spray painted silver some years ago and the paint is now worn off, making it look terrible. I ordered an omelette and waited fifteen minutes for it. When I went there the chefs stood there chatting with my omelette sitting there cold. One chef was standing at the counter as I walked back in reading a newspaper. As I visited during Ramadhan there were not many people for breakfast and there would have been plenty of time to bring it or ask one of the many colleagues to bring it. The cappuccino was made with burnt milk. The pastries were either incorrectly baked (vienoisserie not sufficiently proven) or were from the previous day. The quality of breads was appalling. Some of the dishes that may have been of an acceptable quality when they were sent out to the buffet were either stone cold or badly presented. More than one staff member had safety shoes that were falling apart and dirty. The table was neither attended nor cleared. I had to get the cutlery for my family myself. If I can find some good points about this hotel, the beef rendang was excellent, the check in was well done, the greeting from all staff was warm at all times. The price that I paid was about what I would expect to pay (about what I paid before) at le meridian, prince and double tree. Slightly less than I usually pay at traders. Any of these other hotels are light years ahead in the areas of housekeeping, maintainence, food quality and would appear to be professionally managed. For the duration of my stay I did not see anyone who resembled a manager. This is a half hearted and very amateur attempt at a luxury hotel.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Alisha J,"this one perfect example of dont judge the book by its cover.we stayed in this hotel as well as the residence.Before booking this hotel , the reservation department created a number of fuss and headaches (especially miss.Nicole),she was unprofessional and lack of ability to even conserve with client(Dealing with her was like dealing with a fish monger in a market),even due to all this fuss we still thought this hotel was worthwhile as it does profound luxury by its look. when we arrived we dropped off one of our family member at the hotel and were told to move forward for the residence.Upon arriving at the residence it looks sloppy at the lobby itself,when inquired regarding the valet parking , we were told you have to make a round and go towards the hotel site again and park there for valet! we were shocked , as it was a busy and packed day and jam , and now they are saying make a big round !! what type hotel doesnt even provide a parking service which would convenience for the clients?how do u expect people to park the car there and then push their things n come forward (this is 5 star my god even a budget hotel provide better service) this shows lack of responsibility by the hotel staff and negligence showed by the hotel authority itself to not show any care or pampering for their guest.Our check in itself took an full hour , when asked why the delay , we were given unreasonable excuses which you cant even digest.Arrived at the room , the amenities weren't given fully and no tv remotes at all and even dvd player wasn't there.the next day we went to the pool side and shocked too (it was such a tiny pool facing some construction site and the highway and there wasnt a sauna nor a jacuzzi !! the chair was covered with a white cloth and worst of all it was dirty had to put towel all over it just to sit n enjoy the morning sunlight.What sorts of 5 star hotel comes with this much bad service ? this kind of facilities are even able at 3 star hotel these days. our check out was late as hell because the concierge took more than 20 mins just to come and collect the luggage, and again delayed there and i was told by other family member as well the hotel service was bad as well.What sorts of hotel are you running ? is this how a star hotel that always stated profound luxury treates their guest without any sense of responsibilty but charges nearly rm1k for their rooms per nite ? if it werent for the location i would grade this hotel zero!!teach your staff from the reservation to the door bell some manners (this isnt pasar malam ok where the staffs have no manners and being irresponsible).we are paying guest and we shouldnt get treated with this sorts of attitude and negligence",it say's 5 star but its less than a star(dont judge this hotel by the look),Lingkaran Syed Putra,2,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",2014-06-19,59200,2016-10-08 22:20

Call the receptionist and was informed we could check in at 2. But when we arrived at 2.15 pm, rooms were not yet ready and we were given about one hour waiting time. 2. Time passed by and only at 6 pm (again at 6 pm!!!!!), we were told rooms were ready. 3. When we entered the apartment, what we got were : pillows in both rooms were on the floor, beds not ready, towels not provided, little rubbish on the floor,dining table, coffee table and toaster not properly cleaned. Were we angry? Yes. 4. When we asked for compensation, we were told everybody else had to wait too. So???? After having had to wait for 4 hours, we expected a nicer response. 5. Calling the reception counter and housekeeping was another problem. They were too busy to answer the phone we think. 6. And now while we are typing this review, after 38 minutes, the towels still haven't 'arrived'. We are tired, we need to freshen up. Thank God the towels finally arrived after 55 minutes and two phone calls.7. The best part is - though we had requested for the manager to give us a call, we still don't hear from him. Oh yes...we are local tourists only. Perhaps that's the reason our request not that important. Our suggestions :1. Hire more housekeeping staff if you dont have enough manpower.2. Dont allow late checkout on weekends. 3. Dont make a commitment that customer can check in as early as 2 pm (we called and asked for the time to check in) if rooms are not ready. 4.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Baby_Cleo,"My husband and I booked the Gardens Hotel for a night as we had to attend a seminar at the Gardens Ballroom very early the next morning. We paid RM504 in total (incl. taxes) for a Deluxe Double Room with breakfast included. When we arrived, we were checked in easily and was attended to by a really nice girl. She was polite and courteous and told us what we needed to know for our stay. When we got to our room however, we were a little disappointed. There was nothing really wrong with the room. Quite frankly, it had pretty much everything that you needed:- toiletries, - towels, - hair dryer, - iron and ironing board- free wi-fi- coffee and tea making facilitiesBut we were disappointed because it was most certainly not luxurious as it claimed itself to be. The room was quite small, and the deco in general was rather ""cheap"". The arm chair that was in there looked really sorry and battered. The towels that were provided were clean but again very worn... The carpet also looked like it needed a good wash or maybe it should just be changed altogether. The bathroom was ""nice"" in that it had a separate toilet area and a separate shower and bath area. The sink was large and there was alot of counter space which we liked. But there was mold in the shower area which did not impress us at all. It was also really difficult to get the water temperature in the shower right, cause you would either get it too hot or too cold!And for some strange reason only one bath robe was provided when the room was meant for two. Not that we used the bathrobe, but these are the small things just made the hotel average, and most certainly not live up to its name of being a luxury property. The mini-bar was also empty and you had to order drinks up from room service. Admittedly alot of budget or business hotels practice this concept these days, but we did not expect it of a 5 star luxury hotelThe only thing that redeemed the hotel a little was the fact that you could order different types of pillows to suit your fancy, from feather pillows to hard foam pillows etc. Breakfast - There was a huge selection of food which was great if you were a big eater. I don't manage much for breakfast usually and just wanted some scrambled eggs and cereal. The scrambled eggs was unfortunately quite bad, and the chocolate frosties that I had had obviously been left out in the container far too long as it was no longer crunchy. My husband had some toast and yong tau foo which wasn't bad, but also nothing to shout about. Would we stay here again? We would probably only do so if we had to attend another seminar or something as it was really convenient for us. In terms of location however, it really is very good as it is quite central and attached to a really nice upmarket shopping mall (The Gardens) and to a more regular mall (MidValley). So you would be quite spoilt for choice in terms of food and shopping etc. We would not have complained at all if the hotel did not market itself as a luxury hotel with the premium price to boot. We would have been perfectly okay with everything that the hotel had to offer if it was a 3 star hotel. So this is why it has only gotten 3* from us because that was really what it was: a 3* hotel at a 5* price.",DEFINITELY NOT A LUXURY HOTEL,Lingkaran Syed Putra,3,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",2014-05-21,59200,2016-10-08 22:20

Since taken over by St Giles, service at the residences have improved dramatically compared to the past where residences were barely staff to the bones and it is almost always a long wait if any service is required.Rooms are also much better maintained now compared to the past where we would often check into a unit left with dirty kitchen equipment of lacking scissors or knife in the kitchenette.The only downer is often their misguiding promotions where they would offer a 2nd night free or booking 3 nights for the price of 2 but the rack rate is often used compared to the rate you could get when you book without the promotional tag. Apart from that if you are travelling with family and are looking for a apartment style hotel then this would be the choice.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Vignesh215,"For all that they have done well (apartments are spacious and kept clean), The Gardens Residence has grossly disappointed in terms of service attitude and responsiveness. In all honestly, I don't even think they deserve a single rating. We booked three 2-bedroom suites for stay of 3 days and gave the management the headsup that we will be staying there along with our families for a wedding - MY wedding. On the day of arrival, we checked in, and all's happy. They were mostly unwilling to oblige to many of our requests, such as granting us permission to have our vans parked at the drive-through for a bare 15 minutes to pick up our guests on the wedding morning. That's all ok. Our nightmare began when on the SECOND day of our stay, while checking in some of our relations from Singapore to the residence, the counter lady mentioned in passing, ""oh, by the way, there's a power outage this midnight to 5am""... that's on the wedding day itself. NO COMMUNICATION was attempted to inform us of this scheduled power maintenance exercise even though we've booked the hotel MONTHS in advance. ""Do you have a power back up?""... ""Yes, but nope, your room will have NO air-con, NO lights till 5am or maybe later. If your makeup artist and cameramen are coming, we can lend you a torchlight."" You heard me right.The staff did not give us any options nor attempt to find us a solution.. it's like saying it's just too bad that we will be affected by power outage. Seriously, how can a big hotel like you not have a power back up? We have travelled the world and stayed in countless hotels, this must be the WORST run hotel with absolutely zero service recovery plan. At least have the decency to give us options or move us to the Hotel tower.. which was what happened only AFTER we requested for it. That's total nonsense. Never mind that we paid top dollar to stay in the residence suites and have to be downgraded to a small hotel room next door, this was all done with NO sincere apologies. The breakfast was the worst ever and having to wait for the food is completely unacceptable. It took them 45 minutes to serve us the first dish.. There were many visibly disgruntled guests at the breakfast area and we were definitely one of them. We walked out before all the food arrived because we simply couldn't wait anymore.My family and friends have booked more than 20 rooms across Gardens, Boulevard and Cititel for this wedding. We really did not expect this kind of utter crap service.. speechless. The staff needs to be sent to school...even the hotel manager.

As an example they put out drinks that had not been chilled, they did not provide bottle openers nor glasses, and when you asked for those things they would take away the bottle to open it or pour the drink. So you had to find them to repeat the process every time you wanted something.On our last night we scheduled a wake up call for 4 am with the concierge to get to the airport.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,QeylaAleeqa,"We stayed at The Gardens Residence on January. My parents in law was with us. So we take the apartment with 2 bedroom. The apartment is spacious, comfortable and had all the basic need. We only stayed for a night. We then decided to come back again but this time we book a hotel room because this time no parents, only three of us.From the moment we arrive, it was the worst experience ever! My hubby drop me and our baby off at the entrance. Sorry, we only drive a Malaysian car and not some luxury imported car, the bell boy went straight to the luxury taxi behind us! I was carrying my baby and we had many luggage and stuff with us. When my husband ask for their help, then they help. The room was fine, it was spacious and clean, with lot's of cupboard and drawers. The view is fine at night just because you won't see the construction site and the dirty river. The restaurant looks like a cheap restaurant and the pool had the city view.We stayed for a week. On our 4th night, we come back from dinner and it was about 10pm, we eagerly want to get in and put down our baby who is already asleep on my husband shoulder. However, the door won't open even though the key card was fine. It did show the yellow blink. I pick up the phone from our floor to get some help, but no one answered. So I went down to the front desk. The staff at the front desk give me a card and ask me to try open our door room with it and he told me to use the phone from the floor and ask for help if the door still won't open. And guess what? the door won't open and I call from the floor phone and no one pick it up! I call the hotel from my handphone and no one answer too! My husband went down and ask for help My baby already awake.. We waited for the maintenance to come and open our door. The maintenance staff had to take off the door knob to open the door. He let us in first before assemble back the door knob. It was about 10.30 pm. When we came in, there was a note on the floor saying that they tried to return our laundry but we put up 'DO NOT DISTURB' sign. I immediately call the laundry service and told them that they can return our laundry. I thought it takes about 15-30 minutes to return our laundry. However, they call our room at 12.30 midnight saying that someone will come to our room to return our laundry. We were tired and already asleep. There was a laud banging sound on our door. My husband open the door but nobody there. There's another phone call, my husband pick it up and ask them not to disturb us. We stayed at 5 hotels for the last 2 months but this is by far the worst hotel experience!

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,CalvinOng1982,"3rd time staying at The Gardens and wonderful stay. Stayed at Executive room for 2 nights from 20 to 22 Feb 2014. Executive rooms basically means 25 to 27 floor rooms and the highest floor at 29 is the Executive level. We arrived around 12pm at Megamall carpark and took some 20minutes to find a parking lot at Basement 4. Carpark is huge with numerous security personnel, which makes you feel safe and unsafe at the same time. Rooms are spacious and views are nice, except that there are high rise office buildings all around. It should be the off-season looking at the relatively few guests in the hotel. Staff are polite and service good. Breakfast spread is very good, but would have been better if there is machine-grinded coffee.Soft drinks in mini-fridge and 3-pieces of complimentary laundry was a nice gesture. However, during our first night, I was bathing when the hot water pipe bursted and thankfully there were no kids around and we had to pack all our things in a frenzy, with me just wiping off soap using a towel. However, the hotel was prompt to change another room for us, but it took another 30minutes for us to settle after packing and unpackingProximity to Megamall is a huge point and train station but you dont really need to travel out of the area. 2 cinemas are around and there is one really close to the hotel (GV Gold Class) so you can watch some late night movies before going back to the hotel.

It's the small things, like how the there wasn't any soap on the 6th floor restroom facility or how a hostess doesn't seat you for your buffet breakfast.

Not sure of what to write as other people are finding this hotel quite the opposite....We stayed there in December 11-14/ 2013 to be exact as we wanted something different (Not sure what the different tho..a hotel is a hotel). Was given a room on the 16 floor if I could remember. We requested for a back to back room if possible as we booked 2 rooms separately but was told that the rooms occupancy was full. Never mind that. Hmm...Maybe because we booked through Agoda.comSo we checked in and everything was alright. Next we requested for an extra towel which took like ages before it was sent up. Anyone experience this before? It happens all the 3 days when we were there despite telling them we need 3 towels instead of 2. Hmm... Maybe because its December and lots of the hotel staff are on-leave too.The first night, we were rudely awaken by a loud bang and unceasing doorbell ringing on our door. I shouted at the intruder and after that open the door to find that no one was around except the lingering smell of the leftover hangover liquor. Hmm...Maybe the next door guy got confuse with the room number. Silly fellow! But it really annoyed me as I couldn't sleep afterwards. Report it to the security??? What can they do besides checking on the cctv camera.Also on the first day, I have requested for one small to medium size carton box from the concierge but was told to come back tomorrow and place a booking? Strange....as I have stayed in numerous hotel and even the cheaper ones always will accommodate the guess request. Hmm...Maybe Gardens Hotel have a different take on this.On the positive side, the breakfast was scrumptious and varied. Enjoyed talking to the waiter there as he was humorous. Forgot his name but he was quite of age. Maybe in his forties or early fifties. God bless his cheerful disposition.

My only regret was that I could not extend my appreciation to the FD Executive on duty.The only ""low point"" of my stay was the initial room that I was given. It was in need of refurbishment; however, the FD Executive took care of it in an instant and arranged all the logistics. New room was within the standards of a fine establishment.What impressed me most was the service of the Executive Floor staff! They actually made it a point to make guest welcome. I can attest to this as there was a group of guest in the lounge from morning to night, yet the courtesy extended was commendable!The Que and Siti from the lounge were stupendous in their service! Extremely pleasant and helpful! Kudos to both of them!!I am penning this on my second of a three night stay as I feel it's warranted. As a seasoned traveller, I must commend the hotel for their ethos. Having stayed in most major 5-Star hotels in KL and around the world (all Club/Executive Floors), GHR definitely ranks as one of the best (definitely in KL)! I am definitely making it the preferred hotel for business and personal travel!

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Depipis,"This is our 2nd stay at the hotel and I must say it just get better. We stayed on the 20th floor and were given the corner deluxe room. Both me and my family really love this hotel and we will definitely return again. We are a family of 2 adults and 3 kids. LocationLocated in the Gardens Mall, it is connected to the mall through a side door. The Mid Valley megamall is also connected to the hotel via a link bridge at Gardens Mall. Our 3 nights there wasnt enough to shop around and anything you need, you can probably find it there at mid valley. Traffic is very temperamental. A moment is can be clear and another moment jammed tight. Train station is at Mid Valley Megamall.RoomI consider this as the main highlight of our trip as we were really impressed by the room. It was spacious and has a relax chair near the ceiling to floor window. The room feels modern and equipped with a 40 inch LCD TV with all the modern channels including FOX movie and HBO. The bathroom was the best in all the hotel so far. Super super spacious. Separate shower and bathtub. Shower is with a rain shower. The shower and toilet is separate and enclosed completely. Thus you will not feel cold when bathing or using the toilet. See photos attached. All amenities are available and topped up daily. ServiceService was great. We were there early and yet they allowed us to check in with one room first. Housekeeping was promptly and very friendly. I do have a complaint for the concierge. The bell boy who sends the luggage to our room wore his shoes when walking in our room which we certainly do not appreciate. We hope the staff can respect our room and take off their shoe when they wish to enter the room. Food(breakfast)Good spread of food. We did not have the chance to try all the food. The food was regularly top up except for the fruit and yogurt section. It was a bit slow. One good point to note is that the buffet does cater to vegetarian as they have a vegetarian corner. Facilities We tried the swimming pool on the 2nd and 3rd day. The pool was normal and nothing special. The children pool is very small and can only fit about 5-6 children only. It was disappointing to know that the pool closed at 7pm. They should open it till 9pm at least. The gym was beside the pool and from the look of it, it was very spacious and equipped with modern equipment.

When I checked in on the first day, I was greeted by an expressionless and unfriendly front desk who never greeted me (not even a Hi!) and I had to call out to him to help me check in.

Accepting that, we waited around as we were told that they will give us a call when the rooms are done. After an hour and no phone call, we went back to the lobby and was told that the rooms were not ready yet - it was already 3. They told us that 1 out of our 3 rooms was ready so we specifically reminded them twice to send all our luggage to that one room because we had valuables in them. The front office also told us that the other 2 rooms will be ready before 4pm. Again, we were bombarded with more apologies that our rooms were still not ready after 4pm! To add salt to the wound, their shift had changed and our luggage (all 11 pieces) were still left at the bell man area, at an open space! We had to express our displeasure for them to get us our rooms and call for the bell man to send our bags. This is just unacceptable for a so-called 5 star hotel! Besides, there was not even effort to provide any form of compensation or consolation, and we went into our rooms to find that the extra bed we had already paid for was not even sent. It was the last straw for us so we went to the front office asking to talk to the manager. At least the person who came to talk to us was apologetic and offered us complimentary late check out for one of our rooms.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,jwee92,"We had previously stayed at the Gardens Hotel and found it satisfactory.As there were 5 of us, we booked the 2 Bedroom Deluxe at the Gardens Residences and was disappointed with our stay. We paid a higher price for the apartment and same price for the breakfast as that of Gardens Hotel. However, to our surprise we were told we had to have a semi buffet breakfast (with limited spread) at the Pastis Restaurant next to Gardens Residences which was pathetic in comparison to the Buffet Breakfast at The Spread in the Gardens Hotel (paying same breakfast rate and getting a raw deal)!After much haggling with the Reception and Duty Manager, we were eventually allowed to dine at The Spread because we were repeat guests. However, they were not very accommodating. I was told in no uncertain terms, that this is the one and only time that they will make an exception!If we had booked 2 rooms and added an extra bed at the Gardens Hotel, the room rate would have been cheaper and we would have enjoyed a better breakfast buffet at the Spread. Why the discrepancy? We paid more for our stay at the Garden Residences and same price for the breakfast as the Gardens Hotel and yet we were given an entirely different treatment.As with regards to the 2 Bedroom Deluxe, we found it to be quite old and lacking.Wooden Furniture shows its age. Beds were hard and uncomfortable. Imagine the bath room without clothes hangers? Where does one hang clothes and used towels? Also, a lack of dustbins was a problem. 2 dustbins in the whole apartment? We will not return to the Garden Residences. Perhaps the Gardens Hotel.

Separate bath and shower and toilet4. Pre dinner spread at executive lounge is good (5.30-7.30pm). Didn't manage to try the afternoon tea (available 2.30-4.30pm)5. A range of pillow is available for selection and the feather pillow is good.Cons:1. Service is poor for a 5 star hotel. e.g: checked in at 3.30pm and was told that room is not available, laundry send in the morning and got back the nx morning after calling them several times to check for status, inform hotel to clean room and after we went out for a few hours, no one came and clean the room2. Breakfast food is so so only3. Difficult to find parking as the hotel doesn't have its dedicated parking slot for its guest (spend about 30 mins looking for parking space after each time going out). There is also a RM5 parking fees that you need to pay each time u exit the hotel, no complimentary parking.Overall it is an ok hotel but not worth its 5 star rating.

The metered red budget taxis are plenty (located outside Robinson entrance -behind the lobby and half the price compared to the blue executive taxi in front of the lobby).

It's very convenient especially after your meetings or sight seeing it's easy to get around and find food as the mall is walking distance and all covered. Especially in KL city center area the traffic at peak is really bad and when raining can get worse. So it's best if you can walk around when things jammed up and not exposed to the elements. The rooms in the hotel are modern and good. The TV reception needs improvement as the quality of the TV channels are not very clear and some channels are grainy. The breakfast is good but can get full and have a hard time to seat as not enough seats for a very big hotel such as this. The wifi is decent not the fastest but enough to download emails and surf.

The area to relax around the pool is very small with few loungers. The gym is very well equipped, it does feel like a room with a lot of machines plonked in it. Not much atmosphere or inspiration here. The mall is both a blessing and a curse, the parking is a nightmare but the choice of eateries and shops being close by is amazing. However the hotel's atmosphere suffers slightly, perhaps I was here on a quiet night but the hotel felt deserted!

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Lin T,"This is a very delayed review but only just have time to write now. Stayed in a 2-bedroom apartment at Gardens Residences for just over a month from early July 2013. Myself and 3 children. Overall, our stay was very comfortable. Staff very friendly and helpful. Apartment was well laid out, quite clean and location was great for the convenience of being able to go down to the mall for groceries/food.However, experience marred by a few factors. Two were minor and resolved very quickly by the maintenance staff. First was a bad leak in ceiling due to a blocked air-conditioner filter. Second was a faulty door lock mechanism. But the maintenance guys (very polite and friendly chaps) were very good and while it took time for them to fix, they did arrive quickly on those separate occasions.However, one seemingly small problem which really spoilt my stay towards the final two weeks was due to a simple issue of a broken down washing machine. While I was kindly provided with an apartment on the same floor as the laundrette (as requested in my booking), of the two washing machines in there, only one was working. As anyone with young children will know, the washing machine is absolutely essential, and more so in the hot climate where sweaty clothes pile up quickly. The first couple of weeks were fine as I seemed to be the only one using it. On a few occasions in the final weeks, it would be occupied and the second washing machine was still out of order. I brought this to the attention of the duty manager each time I needed to do the laundry and commented that it should have already been fixed. And I was told the reason it was not fixed was because they were awaiting spare parts. For two weeks?? I find that completely incredulous that it would take that long. I would have expected the machine to be replaced anyway, for the convenience of the residents, if the timeframe was that long. For the price paid for the service apartments, it should have been done.Needless to say, this simple matter caused me much inconvenience and wasted time. With only one machine, each time it was occupied I had check the time the machine cycle would finish. If the resident who was using it at the time was considerate, I would find the machine free to use by the end of the cycle. Unfortunately, that meant me having to troop back and forth every 15mins to check (the laundrette was located to the other end of the hallway of my room) if they were not. I could have removed their clothing from the machine, but there was no table or anywhere clean to put them on! (I can hear some of you saying...you should have just dumped it on the floor! True...but I just couldn't. Silly me...) So I could only notify the duty manager of this problem, complain about the broken machine again, and wait. And as the only time I could do the laundry was at night, I didn't sometimes start till 10.30pm. And the other option of lugging all my laundry to a self-service laundrette (dobi) in Mid-Valley was just not feasible. I had expected to have this convenience at my doorstep, for the price I was paying for the apartment.The final straw was one night when I ended up doing the laundry at 1am (couldn't wait till the next day as clothes had run out!), as the person occupying the washing machine didn't remove their laundry for over an hour and the duty manager had to send up one of their staff to take care of that (saw it later in a plastic basin, placed on the floor of the laundrette. Note to Gardens Residence...need a table in there!).I informed the duty managers how unhappy I was with this situation. It needlessly added to the stress I was experiencing on a daily basis, running around for my kids as well as attending to my elderly parents (who were in hospital at the time with health issues) and the last thing I wanted to deal with was, of all things, simple laundry! I made this very clear to the duty managers. I said I wanted to speak to the Residence manager about this and was told that all this would be in a report and brought up in the staff meeting. I didn't hear anything from anyone after that. I am just disappointed by this experience, as it was already a stressful trip and I had booked the more expensive serviced apartment option at Gardens precisely for the service and peace of mind. I was also disappointed in not having been contacted by the manager for an explanation, which goes to show they might have deemed this as trivial and not worthy of any consideration?? The washing machine was still out of action when I left...after a month... (fyi, it was on the 30th floor)",Washing machine...out-of-order for a month!,Lingkaran Syed Putra,3,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"London, United Kingdom",2013-10-16,59200,2016-10-08 22:21
Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,kenttan,"Not sure about others but my overall impression was a tad on the low side especially if you drive. It was difficult to find a parking lot (no exclusive lots for hotel guests) and parking is not free given the 5-star rate you are paying for the room. So by the time you park you car, it can take between 10-20 minutes from bag drop off to check-in; unless you want to pay a fee to use their valet service. To drive out, you have to endorse your parking ticket each time - and pay for it at the exit. Again, small inconvenience but it adds up. All this coupled with a broken door handle on my room door.. duh!

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Eyekaytoo,"I recently stayed for 4 nights in the Garden hotel which had been selected by my local colleagues for a company workshop. I arrived in the early evening on the first day and was courteously and efficiently checked in. My room on one of the upper floors was sumptuous. It contained an enormous, comfortable king sized bed, large flat screen TV, discreet lighting and large picture windows. Tea and coffee making facilities were available and there was a modern safe for all my valuables. I had access to free WiFi in my room. The bathroom was ultra-modern with a tropical rain type shower head as well as bath tub and conventional shower. Complementary shoe shining facilities were a bonus ensuring that my shoes got their first new polish since I was last visiting Asia Breakfast was a very exotic Asian affair in the rather canteen type environment of the main all day dining restaurant. The experience of Malaysian beef rendang curry for breakfast was rather unique. We also used the same restaurant for the lunches during our company workshop and we enjoyed a wide variety of Malaysian and other Asian cuisine served to perfection. I used the hotel limo pick up and set down service to and from the airport as I had quite a lot of luggage. I was met at the arrivals hall and whisked through to the pick-up point effortlessly. The drive in was smooth, air conditioned with bottled water available for the thirsty traveler. The location of this hotel was special. It is next to the large Mid valley shopping complex which meant we could do our shopping, visit other restaurants and the cinema in our spare time without ever breathing fresh air. Getting to the main attractions such as the Petronas Twin Towers was easy, either by the train system which is clean and air conditioned (and popular) or by taxi. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and look forward to returning soon.","Comfortable hotel, nicely located for all amenities",Lingkaran Syed Putra,4,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Leverkusen, Germany",2013-10-04,59200,2016-10-08 22:21
Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,NedL,"I've stayed at the Gardens Hotel and the adjoining Residences several times over the last few years for business trips. I've always been impressed with the excellent service, comfortable accommodation and convenient location.However in recent times (staying at the Residences) I've begun to notice some wear and tear that detracted from my overall enjoyment. Some examples:- Carpet quite frayed in some locations, particularly between the bedroom and bathroom.- Rust/corrosion behind the faucet the bathroom sink.- Some lights not working.- Balcony door not rolling easily.- Toaster oven generating smoke when it's on. (I didn't end up using it!)- The front door not closing properly unless it is slammed. (Security issue if you forget.)They have also replaced the halogen down-lights in the bathroom and kitchen with LED lights. While I'm a fan of energy-saving measures, this means that the lighting at the bathroom sink is very dull. It's like they've gone for a cheap option without actually checking what the result would be.Overall I'd still recommend The Gardens Hotel & Residences, but I'm concerned that their standards are slipping.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,tokyotony,"We stayed at the Garden Residences for 4 nights, and booked their Two Bedroom Premier apartment. I was able to book on their website without any issues, and had several email exchanges with the hotel beforehand with questions and was able to get answers within 24 hours.We went to the venue by taxi after arriving in the middle of KL by bus. You can tell the driver to go to Mid-Valley. While the location is well-known, some drivers may not understand your English and showing them a map with an address helps, especially so that they can drop you off at the right place within Mid-Valley, which is a huge shopping complex. Also, be sure that they drop you off at the residence and not the hotel (the residence will be after the hotel).There were a total of 4 people in our party staying at the apartment including our 11 year old son. My first impression was that of the lobby, which I found a bit pack with people and the interior a bit tired. I was wondering if I had made a mistake, and that we were going to be staying at a place that would have way too many people (eg crowded pool, overbooked restaurants, staff too busy to care). Well, dont judge a book by its covermy initial impression was only an impression. Check in was rather easy to do, and the front desk was very helpful.When we got to our room, my next first impression was, wow, very spacious. I can definitely say you wont be disappointed with the amount of space you are getting, especially if you are a family of 4 or less. The kitchen area was large and included all the things you need to cook and serve a proper meal if you really wanted to (we really only needed breakfast since we were too lazy to venture out in the morningduring most of the other times we ate out since it was so convenient to just go next door to get something). Each of the bedrooms had good-sized bathrooms with showers and one of the bathrooms had a bathtub. Water pressure is strong and plenty of hot water for showers/bathing, but the shower knobs seem to go in the wrong direction to turn off and on. The venue supplies plenty of toiletries including bath gel, shampoo, toothbrushes with toothpaste, razors, and Q-tips. There was a ceiling fan in the living room which is nice since it allows you to turn off the aircon from time-to-time. There were only a few electrical outlets around so, as I have written in other reviews, bring one or two power strips if you have a lot of electrical gadgets that need charging. There were TVs in each of the bedrooms and in the living rooms but only a handful of channels to watch. We brought our Roku streaming box with us that worked okaywifi is decent but it will require you to buffer a lot of video before it really gets going. (Im sure an AppleTV would work just as well.) Normal web surfing and checking emails on a computer, phone or table work fine.The overall ambience of the apartment is nothing to write home about. The carpets were a bit drab and the finishings a bit dull and darkthe room could definitely use a bit of a facelift. (From the other review, I can see the hotel rooms have a lot better interior.) No reason to look out the windows at the view since theres not much to look at except construction happening around the area. (The apartment, though, is quiet  you dont notice the construction sounds unless you open the windows.) They do have a decent pool that is shared with the hotel and several restaurants on the hotel side, and the gym (while we didnt use it) looked very well equipped and maintained. There is a very nice Japanese restaurant at the hotel and we were quite pleasantly surprised at receiving a very, very reasonable bill for very high quality Japanese food and plenty to drink.Keep in mind that you will be staying in kind of a busy city center which makes it convenient to go out and shop and have a drink, but you are not really getting an idea of local foods and culture. Since we had been to KL several times, we were there for the former, especially since the sister-in-law wanted to do some shopping. So, this place suited us well.The residence is right next to two very large shopping malls: The Gardens (which I would consider more upscale) and Megamall. They have grocery stores where you can buy supplies (we just bought snacks, drinks, and breakfast supplies). The malls have a variety of Western and other types of restaurants including Chilis and even an Irish pub! I forgot, though, that smoking is still allowed in public establishments and found the pub a bit too smoky at times. ATMs can take overseas ATM cards.If you want to go out at night, again, you are really in a shopping mall complex so there is not much to walk out to except for the restaurants and the few pubs in the mall. For daytime activities, we did visit the Sunway Lagoon Waterpark, which takes about 15-20 minutes by taxi and will cost you less than RM20 (if you dont ride a premium taxi). After our time at the water park, we then hung around one of the restaurants for food and drinks. We also took a day tour around KL which was quite nice (see separate review). When you do leave for the day, do make sure you turn on the Make up the Room lightthey pretty much follow this. Overall, I can recommend the Gardens Residence for a family or party of 4 who wants to just hang out in the apartment and wants to enjoy the convenience walking right next door to go shopping or wine and dine at the restaurants, and the possibly take the occasional day tour. If you are looking to venture out your door for some culture, some street food, or hang out outside surrounded by nature, best to go elsewhere. For this location, convenience is the key word. For us, this matched what we wanted for this trip.",It's all about Convenience and not about the Culture,Lingkaran Syed Putra,5,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Singapore, Singapore",2013-09-26,59200,2016-10-08 22:21

A flat RM15 per entry per day (I would think it's the cheapest valet parking from a 5* hotel in KL).The biggest advantage is that the hotel is adjacent to the Mid-Valley complex (office and shopping). Otherwise, to get to this place under normal circumstance is a nightmare due to the sheer size.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Avengers121,"Spent three nights there in KL and stayed in The Gardens. Have been there as a business traveler but first time bringing whole family (6 adults and 3 children, aged 5, 3, and 2 months). Decent rooms with good facilities.1. Swimming pool - decent size. Would be better if the pool is more child friendly. The current pool is 1.2 M and the kids pool is too small. Water is warm and suitable for young children. 2. Gym - big and spacious. Good number of equipment as well.3. Breakfast - decent selection of food but on the third day, the spread is quite the same. 4. Walking distance to Mid-valley Mall. Good for family with young children and can return to rest at anytime. 5. Good selection of restaurants nearby. Japanese, local delights, western, Thai, Taiwanese etc. 6. If you drive, the valet services is helpful. It would be good if the carpark charges can be waived. 7. Bed was firmed and comfy and I can sleep through the night.

Wanted to wash my hair but checked, there was no hairdryer , so points minused for that. Called housekeeping and asked them to bring a hairdryer ; they said they said they would do it at once but had to call again and this time, they brought it.Main plus point of hotel is its location, big shopping complex adjacent so it's convenient to shop .There are high -end boutiques such as Louis Vuitton so it is a shopper's paradise.Wifi is free for guests & pretty stable.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,The_TravellerSg,"Have stayed here many times and would have considered this one of the better one around with the price paid.However, this trip changed my opinion totally!!2 things stuck out distinctly which is the poor service and bad food. On the 1st morning that I had my breakfast, I ate the local food, porridge and as I was shocked to find sea shell in the food! When I asked for the manager, only the supervisor came over and said he will check. He then came back to say that he is certain the sea shell was not from the porridge but the condiments that goes with the porridge. The bottom line is that whether its the porridge or the condiments, it is food serve at the hotel. Instead of apologising, he keeps saying this is uncommon which of course I know it is not common but he did not apologised except it is not common.The 2nd surprise came at the dinner that same day when my colleague found metallic strip in the cabbage salad they served at the Japanese restaurant and this really makes me very bad and asked that I speak to the management or even the GM. Interestingly, I was told that the GM is in the same restaurant as we were at but he is busy talking to other people. I reiterated that I want to speak to the management and all they said is he is busy and they don't want to disturb him.

My cousin is 4 months pregnant and she needed some hot water. She called downstairs and they told her to use the kettle she explained that it smelled like coffee and was making her feel sick. So they suggested for her to use the hose beside the toilet for her hot water.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,adhansstuff,"We stayed at this hotel and had a terrible experience. I had bought some food and left it on the desk. At 12.30 am i heard a rustling noise. I turned on the light and to my utter shock and horror, saw a rat scampering across the desk. It hid behind the desk. I called the duty manager who came up to the room about 10 minutes later with four housekeeping staff. They turned the room upside down looking for the rat, armed only with a small box and some plastic bags. Not a flashlight or rat trap in sight. After fifteen to twenty minutes of watching them, i had to ask for another room. It did not occur to them to offer me a new room immediately. When we checked out the next morning i expected the management to have already reviewed the happenings of the previous night and to offer me some form of apology and compensation. As the room had been prepaid i was charged for the room service that i had ordered to replace what the Rat had nibbled during the night. I asked to see the manager and they sent the chief concierge to deal with me. After some haggling, he only offered to cancel the room service charge but not the room charge. I was furious but did not want to get into an argument. I requested that the room charge be waived. The concierge promised to contact me after he had spoken to his management. As of today i have been offered a RM100 food and beverage voucher. My room charge was RM409. I am utterly appalled. First of all by the fact that there are rats in this so called luxury hotel. Secondly, the hotel should not be charging me at all for such a terrible experience. They have my phone number but no one has bothered to call to apologize. I only received an impersonal email with barely any form of remorse or regret over the incident.

Tons of shops and restaurants, you will be entertained especially if your focus is on shopping and dining. And if you are tired, just go up to your room and have a nap, and continue your shopping later when refreshed!- Great location near city centre, can travel by train to KL Central station where you can change to LRT or monorail, or taxi is readily available (just make sure driver is willing to use meter)- Nice comfortable room, with separate bath and shower. Comfy bed, with good sound insulation. On higher floors, you can get great views of KL city centre- Good courteous service from staff. Breakfast spread is reasonable (although not 5-star quality due to its limited selection), although you can get better breakfast options from variety of restaurants in mallCons:- Very hard to get taxi during weekends or malls closing time. Be prepared for long queue, unless you are willing to pay extra for hotel taxi.- Massive traffic jam around hotel and mall area during peak hours and weekends. Some taxi drivers will even refuse fare during these periods. - Mall is very crowded on weekends, with most restaurants full during meal times, so either eat outside meal times (like 5 pm for dinner or 11.30 am for lunch) or be prepared to queue.Conclusion:Nice comfortable hotel, especially if your purpose is shopping and dining, due to its convenient location next to mid-valley mall complex.

We booked for 4 nights and paid RM530 approx per night (for 1deluxe bedroom), with breakfast for two. (semi buffet)To make things short, I will just highlight the pros and cons. Pros,1.) Large rooms with lots of place to move around2.) The aircond was awesome3.) A ceiling fan in the living room4.) 2 tvs on each room, which we did not have chance to use. We only managed to use one in the living room.5.) Service is good.6.) Full set of kitchenette. (oven, microwave, hood, cooking stove, toaster, etc)7.) Free Of Charge Baby Cot. Cons,1.) The breakfast is not very good. They only allow 1 serving of hot breakfast with all you can eat bread, cereals, fruits, juice, and pastries. But with that much appliance in the kitchen, I suggest you made your own breakfast. 2.) The cover of the kettle is broken. You need to hold the kettle to pour in the water. But it is still usable so I chose not to make a big fuss out of it. 3.) The safety box is completely unusable. It says Low battery. 4.) The tv remote control ran out of battery but it was quickly replaced within 20min of complaint. 5.) Things were a bit inconsistent. Sometimes, the housekeeping is nice. They gave us extra mineral water and were really friendly with my childrens soft toys. Sometimes, the housekeeping only shows up after 4pm. My wife and kids were in room at the time, and I think my wife asked them to leave as my kids were asleep.Let me just say that this is the first time I stayed in a service apartment, so my opinion may be a bit biased as I only have a hotel to compare with.

We left the room in the morning at around 9 AM for our engagements, and returned at about 4.30 PM to rest, wash-up in preparation for the evenings events. And guess what?

At approximately 5 PM, somebody budged in through the door without knocking, and you have guessed it!! The cleaners have arrived, just as we were settling down. They were instructed to return in an hours time. We left at 6 PM so as to allow the cleaning to be done. At 7.30PM, we returned and.the room was still exactly as it was two hours ago!! We decided to depart for the evening after a quick wash-up, and proceeded to inform the reception that the room does need cleaning. We return to the room later in the evening and hesitantly opened the door, expecting the expected but breathe a sigh of relief that it was finally done. A letter to the hotel only solicited a pathetic excuse from the management, that the cleaners need to do the occupied rooms last, whilst the recently vacated rooms get done first.

The kitchenette was fully equipped with a fridge, stove, oven, microwave oven, toaster, cutlery, cooking utensils, dishwashing liquid and sponge, coffee and tea, plates and even microwave-friendly containers. The only hiccup during our stay was the long wait for our room to be ready. We had requested for our room to be on the same floor as my sister's and we guessed that was probably why we had to wait nearly 1.5 hours after the normal check-in time of 2pm.

Not bad at all, this one has yogurt with several flavors but i have seen better kitchen with more food selection. The checkout was smooth. Wifi signal strong throughout the building (thumbs up!). Room is big enough. So convenient you can shop downstairs at the gardens or midvalley. Food and entertainment is aplenty. Fast laundry service. Very convenient.","totally changed my opinion.

Beds & bed-wear of good quality.Despite our booking and re-confirmation by telephone there was no baby bed available upon arrival (late). We build a cot using the towels and furniture and let our baby sleep on the floor. Very inconvenient of course but mistakes can happen. The least we would expect would be an excuse but ... Nothing no word was mentioned. I feel that guests should not be unreasonable as mistakes can happen. But for me 5* should also stand for the level if service and guest attention to correct mistakes in a decent way.We would not stay again as we believe that there is more value for money in KL. but if you are staying don't worry, it is a good and decent hotel.",Ok 4* hotel - but they let our baby sleep on the floor and no sorry ..,Lingkaran Syed Putra,3,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Singapore, Singapore",2013-06-23,59200,2016-10-08 22:21

Perfect location for shopping if that takes your fancy (attached to two connected malls, one smallish but upmarket, the other massive and more mainstream). Eating opportunities about within the malls, between on the street and in the hotel. The number of big name American brand eateries is surprising, places like Tony Roma's, Chiili's, TGI's, Kenny Rogers Roasters, etc. Also, an Irish pub for good measure. Walking distance (connected by the mall) to the Kommuter Train which gets you to KL sentral, from where you can take the MTS to many other locations around the centre of KL.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,autrumn,"Stayed in the Executive Room at the hotel from 4 to 7 Jun 2013. First time opting to stay in the Mid Valley area, instead of a hotel at the crowded Bukit Bintang. A pleasant experience overall, pros & cons below for your consideration:Pros- Excellent location as the hotel is linked to The Gardens Mall, which in turn is linked to Mid Valley Megamall...Loads of shopping & F&B outlets for explore- Hotel room was reasonably comfortable. There was a separate toilet & shower room, which is very handy. Bed & pillows were comfortable.- Staff were generally friendly & polite. - The executive lounge is quiet, comfortable & serves drinks/meals at teatime/pre-dinner. Very handy for those who need a quick bite.- Breakfast spread was generous (but we soon got tired of it by the 3rd day)- The hotel is not super crowded, which is good for those who need a quiet rest.Cons- Was bitten by a mosquito in the first room I was allocated. The hotel staff were accommodating enough to allow me to change a room though (though the 2nd room I stayed in was a tad dusty).- Response time of staff was generally slow. I requested for a baby cot & it took the staff 4 hours to send the cot up.Overall, a pleasant experience & will still recommend this hotel to those who want to experience a hotel not located in the Bukit Bintang area. Would have been good if the hotel provided free airport transfer for those staying in their executive rooms.",Mostly nice with a few points for improvement,Lingkaran Syed Putra,3,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,Singapore,2013-06-12,59200,2016-10-08 22:21

At the reception desk, staff is friendly to process my check in and in fact most of staffs in the hotel I encountered were friendly. The room is spacious with nice furnishing and WIFI is another great bonus for use. My kids enjoyed the swimming pool and the kids pool just by the side. In fact the location here is so good that I don't have to go to Bukit Bintang area for shopping and food. The mall have wide choices of food like Japanese food, Din Tai Feng, Canton-I and etc. Cinemas were packed with people during the weekend as for me I bought advance tickets for the show.But something upset me before I check out as there were some works going on which I was not aware. We were thinking of having a nice shower before we check out but in surprise we were greeted by stained water which even after few minutes running, the water was still in the same condition. In fact I took a photo of the stained water and was preparing to show to the staff when I checked out but was disappointed with the reception staff response. When I asked him is it there are some water works going on and he replied me yes for maybe about 1-2 hours. He said 'sorry for any inconvenient caused'. In fact the management could have inform guests before hand so that we could actually know about the situation.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,ttChet,"This was our second stay on this property. The first stay was at the Hotel. For this trip we stayed at the Residence. The Residence is basically like a serviced apartment. We stayed in a 1-bedroom apartment. Th unit has a living area, a small kitchen and a bedroom. Room area is very generous. There is basically no services at the Residence - no restaurant & no breakfast. The only facility is the swimming pool which is shared with the hotel. CarparkWe drove and so had to park at the Midvalley car park. Since this is shared with the mall, it is always difficult to find a parking lot. Maximum parking charge per day is RM5 but you need to get the front office to validate your ticket before you pay st the payment booth. WiFiFree wifi throughout the facility, even in the rooms. This is a big plus. Speed was very good. Download speed = 5.65Mbps, upload speed = 1.99Mbps. Swimming poolReasonably size pool with a separate kids splash pool. No services. Pool towels are left on a counter for self collection. RoomVery large room. 2 TVs - one in the room and the other in the living room. Bathroom has separate shower area, bathtub and toilet. There is also another sofa bed in the bedroom, which was good for a third guest. There is a balcony area but not much of use as the room we had was facing a construction site and roads/expressways (just noisy and dusty). All basic stuffs are provided for. Not much frills. ConclusionGreat if you are a sucker for large rooms and you intend to do some light cooking. Convenient location at Midvalley City - for all shopaholics. But these come with a hefty price tag - almost RM500/night for a 1-bedroom unit and more than RM700/night for a 2-bedroom unit.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Herbert6,"Recently stayed in this hotel in Mid Valley City near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I was on a business trip and the location of our guests was just around the corner.The hotel itself is of excellent quality. Good service, clean and spacious rooms, great choice of food and drinks, nice staff, beautiful swimming pool. The hotel is also directly linked to the Mid Valley Mega mall. A really big mall, where you can find every type of shop or restaurant. Between two buildings of the mall, you have a green corridor with a lot of restaurants and bars where you can relax and enjoy food en drinks all day long.If you are on a tourist trip and want to see the city center, you need a rather long taxi drive (minimum 20 -25 minutes to e.g. the Petronas Towers). Depends also a lot on the traffic.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Paul H,I stayed at The Gardens Hotel & Residences as it was more convenient to where I was going to be working than the hotels I have previously used in PJ or KL. I chose an executive room as I find the convenience of being able to use the executive lounge. The lounge is on the 29th floor but my room was on the 27th. The room was light and airy with plenty of room to work and the lounge offered evening snacks and drinks plus the convenience of having breakfast there rather than in the restaurant.The hotel is located beside two large shopping malls and everything you can possibly need is available without leaving the building. There is a large food area on the lowest level at the mall but it takes some getting used to the layout of the two malls as it isnt as straightforward as it first seems.Transport to and from the hotel is easy as taxis are plentiful and I used the KLIA Ekspres to get from the airport and then a short taxi ride from the KL Sentra station.The only downside to my whole stay was on the last evening there was quite load music being played until 03:30 that was not load enough to wake you but load enough to keep you awake if you woke. I was advised this was probably from the private event being held on level 5 so maybe it would be best to choose a city view side room to avoid this.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Snow_bright_river,"I stayed at this hotel in Feb 2013. Our office is in Gardens, so it was the most convenient location. The location wise, it's great. One of the largest shopping complex in SE Asia being adjoined means you dont have a problem finding food. You may have a problem choosing one, though. :-) There are a few supermarkets in The Gardens, and you can grab snacks and drinks easily too. The room is nice and spacious, but the carpet floor can get feel a bit dump if you leave the aircon off for a whole day. It's just the carpet floor doesnt suit Malaysian weather. So I did what I do when I stay at hotels. Left a 'card' in a room key holder, and aircon run during the day. I know this isn't environmentaly friendly so set the temp relatively high. That works the treat for carpet. Also you can keep changing stuff while you are out. You can either ask for an extra key card or just use any card. My boss told me even her business card worked. Only issue I had with this hotel was the noise from the nightclub below. I was on 10th floor and the windows were vibrating. Hotel cannot do anything ad tge nightclub is not a part of the hotel. Especially on weekend, the music lasted untill 3am. So if you stay there, ask for the room beyond 12 floor or the other side from the night club.

The gym is very large, and the buffet breakfast downstairs also seemed to be pretty big (though I used / consumed neither). The executive lounge on the top floor serves very decent food, much better than, say, The Hilton.Food-wise, there's a plethora of restaurants in the two malls, which are linked by multiple walkways so it's easy to walk between them. There's a Din Tai Fung, as well as quite a number of Japanese retaurants. Sage, the flagship restaurant at The Gardens, serves great quality Western fare, though it's very expensive by local standards.I am not a fan of the crazy, tourist- and traffic-heavy Bukit Bintang area, but the Gardens is close enough to get there by a short cab ride, and far away enough to gain some peacefulness. Without traffic, it's around 15mins to Bukit Bintang, and around 10mins to Bangsar, where there are also decent malls and great eateries.If you're adventurous enough it's also around 20-25mins (sans traffic) to get to Petaling Jaya / PJ, where you'll find more local (hawker) food and restaurants.Overall this is my go-to hotel when I'm not in KL for work and / or I just want to be away from the middle of KL.",Best Choice Away From Bukit Bintang,Lingkaran Syed Putra,4,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Singapore, Singapore",2013-05-09,59200,2016-10-08 22:21

This Mid Valley/Gardens combination is very big and takes quite a while to explore properly. The other 2 malls are in the KLCC and Bukit Bintang areas (not far apart). I usually stay over there, but thought I'd have a few days in this area for a change. You see the cross town traffic in KL is horrendous in the afternoons and you can age dramatically over the course of a taxi ride. This hotel not only gives access to the mall, it is also close to the upmarket (and expat) area of Bangsar, also with many interesting and varied shopping and eating spots, being located on the Western edge of KL proper.I liked the room I had, up high with a nice view across the river to Bangsar. The staff were excellent, bright and personable, able to remember my name and room number from check in through to breakfast the next day and each following day. Alright, maybe I am funny looking and memorable.Valet parking was only 15 MYR - one of the best deals I've had in Malaysia. Breakfast was terrific with food from a cross section of cultures on offer. You really can fill up for the whole day here.A very nice stay - now if it was over at Bukit Bintang, I would stay here more often",Nice hotel in Mid Valley/Bangsar area,Lingkaran Syed Putra,4,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,Australia,2013-04-22,59200,2016-10-08 22:21
Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,dkeight,"Stayed here in an apartment for 2 weeks as I was working in KL. Last time here I stayed in the Hilton which is next to our office, but The Gardens worked out a lot less expensive and also gives freedom to relax, eat etc that a hotel room cannot. Reception is manned 24hrs with concierge. Secure access to lifts means that the apartments are 100% private. MYou can use hotel pool, gym and restaurants, which are all good and uncrowded whilst I was there. The apartments and hotel are directly above Gardens Mall, which connects to Mid-Valley Megamall, so handy for about 500+ shops and 100 restaurants. Staff were all friendly, room was cleaned efficiently every day, and everything in the apartment worked perfectly. Will return again on my next trip.","Clean, tidy and well run",Lingkaran Syed Putra,4,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Newton Abbot, United Kingdom",2013-04-19,59200,2016-10-08 22:21
Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Irene K,"I was in Rm 1023. Nice room but not much of a view. It faces the office block, a some sort of Malay village with a little view of the KL skyline. The location of the hotel is very conveniently situated near/in the mall and one can move easily within the mall even when it is raining cats and dogs outside as it is all well connected.The staff are very welcoming and polite.However, the housekeeping team will have to pull up their socks! The second day we had a male housekeeper and he just replenished the bottle of water, tidy up the bed, changed the towels and left the room. He did not even bother to vacuum, wipe the toilet nor asked if my mother needed anything else. The bathroom shampoo and bath gel was also not replenished.On the 3rd day we had a lady cleaner. This time she did everything she was supposed to do but took away all our towels and did not replaced it.On the 4th day, the housekeeping service left us with many shampoo and bath gel but forgot to wipe down the bathroom table top.If it was not for the housekeeping service, I would have given all thumbs up for this hotel.I took the KTM train to Central and interchange there for the KLIA train. It is a short walk to catch the train but if you have luggages, I would suggest either catching the taxi to the Central Station or pre-order a airport cab.I did not go for the breakfast package as the shops on the lower basement, between the Garden Mall and Mid Valley Mall, has lots to offer in the morning.Btw, you have to hold on to the room door to shut it quietly. Our rest were disturbed so many times because some guest love to let the door shuts by itself and throughout the late evening and early morning, you will be awaken by the bang! Bang! sound of the door.We were in a non smoking room but in the evening the smell of cigarette travels in through the duct in the toilet.",Convenient,Lingkaran Syed Putra,4,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Hong Kong, China",2013-04-16,59200,2016-10-08 22:21
Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,jefflow242,"My family (me, wife and 2 kids) stayed at The Garden Residence for 2 nights on Mar 23 to 25 during school holiday weekend. We family selected this The Garden because we wanted to do some shopping at MidValley and visiting relatives near this area and the hotel has received good reviews at Tripadvisor. As we need 2 rooms, we opted for the The Garden Residence's two bedroom apartment suites. Bad experience with this hotel started the moment we arrived. We drove to Kuala Lumpur with our family car and on arrival at the apartment/ hotel, we are told there is no dedicated hotel parking but has to use the common car-park of The Garden shopping center. Parking is extremely difficult to get on a busy Saturday and has to wait very long before one become available. If you are driving, I would suggest anyone to avoid this hotel as parking become a big hassle if you drive in and out. Nothing in this hotel that meet my modest expectation. 1. For breakfast, the Garden Residence has a different breakfast spread compare with the hotel. Don't opt for breakfast as this will be dissapointing. 2. The hotel furniture is pretty old and little worn out. Also the chair and sofa is dusty.3. Housekeeping service is slow as they seems to rely the staff from the Hotel to serve the Residence which is about 400m away.Certainly, this hotel is not worth the high price that we have paid for.

The aircon vent in the master bedroom is covered with a cardboard and masking tape! I presume it was too cold and the thermostat/fan did not work properly.I also found there was not enough storage for your clothes. You would have expected more in an apartment. I had to live out of a suitcase.I had stayed in the same property not long ago and I remembered it to be much better. Things have gone downhill in a short time. The last time we had free wifi in the room although I believe it was limited to three users. This time, there was NO WIFI at all although the wireless router was still in the room but unplugged. I rang maintenance. They took a long time and finally came up to have a look, then said that WIFI is no longer available in the property. Then promised to ""find out"" what they can do and come back to me. They rang back and said there was nothing they can do but if I would like to move to a lower floor, WIFI MAY be available. By this stage, we had already unpacked so we decided to stay.We also found ants on my daughter's bed and also in my niece's bed in ANOTHER apartment. We rang housekeeping and they tried to clean up but we still found ants later that night.The great thing about the resort is the location. The garden mall is downstairs and the Mid Vally Mega Mall is the adjacent building.Traffic is pretty bad at certain times getting in and out of the resort though.Like I said.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,SMLTreadlightly,"I have stayed at this hotel several times and reviewed it before. I love it for the location within the upscale Gardens Mall and being linked to the Mid-Valley mega mall. The no-smoking policy is also fantastic (my son has asthma). Great dining options for all budgets and tastes and endless shopping! Suits young family travel as you can pop up to the room so easily and parents can take turns with shopping and having the kids nap or watch a movie in the room etc. I would stay there as a solo lad on business too. It is 5 star rated and worth the extra over its sister properties: Boulevard and Cititel nearby. Nevertheless, on this stay, I noticed the bathroom tiles are showing signs of age - unappealing mould - which needs to be addressed. Just minor maintenance issues - wallpaper peeling, humming a/c etc need attention. Rooms, beds (with pillow) menu and lovely white linens are very comfy. Nice bathrooms albeit fiddly shower controls. Good housekeeping. The location is also a reasonable base for activities in the outer parts of the city eg. south or west. The exec taxis available from concierge are reliable and clean, but opt for the budget taxis from the shopping complex queues if you want to save.

You can find shop/ boutiques from high end to low end as well variety of fine dining resto and cafes. It is also near to lake gardens but be careful in taking a cab lining up outside the hotel, they charge more than the usual like when i take a cab from going to lake gardens i paid around 19 ringgit but when i get back i only paid 6, both cabs are in meter.Room:What i like the most is the bathroom, i like the way they maximize the space for your tub, shower, toilet, and closet. Room is clean daily and had a decent view from my window however the space is just enough for 2 adult and the amenities are basic. Internet is good. You can hear voices from outside. Breakfast:Not enough selection for food. Lobby: Is not that fabulous like other 5 star hotels. It feels good to be greeted by hotel staff, carry on your stuff and usher me to check in area.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Elizabeth L,"I stayed at the gardens hotel in mid valley city in January 2013 on my way to Japan for holiday. This was the third time I stayed at this hotel for a stop over in kuala lumpur. The hotel is located next to two large shopping malls with many shops and restaurants. The staffs at the hotel were all very friendly. Checking in and out were quick and no fuss.the room was clean, bright and comfortable. I especially love the separate toilet and bathroom. I will definitely stay here again on my next visit.",Convenient and comfortable place to stay for a stop over,Lingkaran Syed Putra,4,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Perth, Australia",2013-01-25,59200,2016-10-08 22:21
Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,A_Screw_Loose,"I stayed here one night on a business trip. I was looking forward to this hotel due to its location at MidValley City and its 5 star rating. Overall it was a very good hotel but just let down by niggling issues which should not be experienced for the price that was paid.Pros:-1) Location! Location! Location! If you are an avid shopper or looking for a place to hang out, MidValley City would be the best spot for you. The variety of branded stores, specialty shops, departmental stores (Isetan, Robinsons, Jusco etc) and F&B outlets are simply astounding, with the Gardens Hotel being placed in the more affluent side of this mega complex. 2) Hotel room is clean with the washroom area facing the bed side. Bed is soft and very comfortable and airconditioning was just perfect with a great view of KLCC in the horizon.3) Hotel has a nice spacious gym with the pool next to it at the 5th floor. 4) Hotel has an excellent breakfast spread with more emphasis to Western tastes like croissants, smoked salmon, beef and so on.Cons: -1) Check in was a nightmare and exercise in patience. The process takes 20 excruciating minutes due to the large amount of hotel guests. Our colleagues even have to wait additional 40 minutes for their room to be cleared and they checked in at 3pm even though they already made reservations. 2) Be transported back in time to 2007 to the wired era. My hotel room (2719) room does not have any wi-fi access in the room nor any wifi in the lobby. Internet access is only by using LAN cable. Truly a back to the future moment.3) Be warned if you are driving to MidValley. Get here as early as possible or end up spending an hour or more looking for parking and tearing your hair out. If you park at Gardens, even with the hotel redemption, you still need to pay RM5.4) The access door between the car parking elevators in the shopping complex to the lobby are locked after midnight. Thus we have to walk along the empty halls of the shopping complex and round the corner and outside and then back in again to access the lobby. This would be a wonderful experience if touring empty shopping complexes become the new national pastime. The management should just post a security guard at the access door as walking alone can be quite unnerving.All in all, a very good hotel that I would stay next time once they work out those kinks.","Underwhelming experience for its price range, only fantastic point is the location",Lingkaran Syed Putra,3,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Penang Island, Malaysia",2013-01-21,59200,2016-10-08 22:21
Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Lindaa78,"Firstly, The Gardens Hotel has excellent location. Located at The Gardens Mall and Mid Valley shopping centre in KL, you do not ever have to leave the comfort of the mall, especially if you are there for a short business trip. Food, drinks, entertainment, shopping are within easy walking distance. Secondly, the hotel has a great gym which is clean and spacious for a quick morning workout. The meeting rooms located on 29th floor is also well equipped and I'm pleasantly surprised at the quality of the hotel-catered mini-buffet during lunch and tea breaks. The rooms are spacious with well appointed amenities.

We know or way around KL due to the fact that we lived there for 3 yrs but return each yr for holidays. The Gardens Hotel is very well maintained, the staff are extremely helpful and friendly. The rooms are large with comfy beds, lovely spacious bathrooms and lots of storage space. It is located in Midvalley and attached to 2 huge shopping malls, which gives you direct access to hundreds of shops, numerous supermarkets and loads of restaurants...you could just stay and not ever venture out!! No matter which direction you exit from a taxi is only seconds away, if not already waiting. Also if you are out and about every taxi driver knows where the Gardens Hotel is so it makes the return trip very easy. The Club lounge (very affordable option) has very attentive staff and are always happy to help. The food is delicious and fresh and this is also where to check in and out from so you avoid the queues. This hotel is in a great location because within minutes you can get to Bangsar, Central Market, Petaling St market and Bukit Bintang (depending on traffic of course).

Probably would have been quicker but I arrived in rush hour and the traffic apparently is always pretty heavy during morning and afternoons. The room was very comfortable and had a great view over the city. The room wasnt really big but was more than enough for 1-2 people. The bathroom was really luxurious and the bed was SO comfortable I struggled to want to get out of it!The hotel itself was huge and I got lost several times looking for my room or the restaurant. I have no idea if it had a pool or gym.The foyer of the hotel leads straight into the shopping mall which is quite a few floors of every different shop you'd want to see.I ordered room service for breakfast and evening meal and the food was really good and fantastic value, compared with UK prices.The thought of the steak I had there still makes my mouth water!The staff were helpful, I only saw reception or room service staff, both were professional and efficient.I will be certainly staying here again.",Fantastic hotel right next door to huge shopping mall,Lingkaran Syed Putra,4,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Surrey, United Kingdom",2013-01-06,59200,2016-10-08 22:21
Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Strae,"The Gardens Hotel & Residences is located in Mid Valley, which is very convenient for the main suburbs of KL (i.e. Bangsar, Damansara, Petaling Jaya and KL city centre) but is not at the heart of the city proper. First time visitors looking to take in the main tourist attractions are probably best served staying in the Bukit Bintang area, where most of the main tourist class hotels are located. Having made this initial point, the Gardens Hotel is very strategically located for either seasoned visitors or for those visiting friends and family located in the neighbouring areas. Staying here, guests can flit in and out of various neighbourhoods easily, minimising the time and expense spent in negotiating what can be ferocious traffic snarls. In addition, the hotel is attached to a large mall complex itself, and therefore provides guests with convenient access to a range of amenities, such as restaurants, eateries, cinemas as well as shopping in general. And because the hotel is attached to both the Mid Valley (low to mid-end) and the Garden (mid to high-end) malls, guests have access to both breadth and depth in shopping for both local and international brands. The hotel itself maps to an international 4 - 5 star rating. We stayed in the hotel proper (the residences are aimed at longer-stay visitors or for larger families requiring kitchen facilities) and can happily confirm that the rooms are relatively well designed, quite spacious and clean and well maintained. Rooms have both a nice bath as well as rainfall shower heads and a few other modern amenities such as flat screen TVs, electronic safes and thoughtfully a small refrigerator for guest use in lieu of a minibar.Facilities in general are at a high standard with an excellent outdoor pool (unfortunately not heated) with a wading area for a younger children, an excellent gymnasium (roomy, great views, new equipment) and a well presented business lounge. We did not have the opportunity to dine at the hotel (restaurants are in abundance in the nearby mall and there is great variety at every price point) but they looked inviting at first blush. Aside from the wading pool, there are no specific child-focussed facilities (e.g. kid's club) but there are a range of third party options available in the mall close by.The other point of note is that while wi-fi is free and available in most parts of the hotel, service can be very hit and miss. We occupied three rooms on the same floor and found wi-fi reception very strong in one room and almost non-existent in the other two.Service levels are great for this class of hotel but on our visit there were a few jarring instances that reminded us that there was room for improvement. E.g. At check-in, we had to negotiate quite aggressively to obtain the 3 rooms on the same floor that we had requested, despite having prepaid for our stay and having booked close to 11 room-nights in total. Not exactly the treatment we thought we would get as a significant customer. Also at check-in, we were waiting to board the elevator when a porter arrived with luggage (not ours). When the elevator door opened, the porter went straight in, thereby leaving us and another set of guests having to wait for the next elevator, despite the fact that we had been waiting before his arrival! Finally, during our stay there was disruption to the hot water service on our floor. Management made no attempt to communicate with guests (which is what we'd expect) and we had to approach several members of staff to have the problem attended to. These incidents are not deal breakers, but are indicative of the brusque (if practical) service levels overall. None of these anecdotes detracted from a pleasant experience overall - but they do indicate the (small) gap between locally managed hotels and the international chains - a gap that is definitely closing over time.Overall, this is an exceedingly well located property for those with some familiarity with KL that provides high quality accommodation at a reasonable price. There is some room for improvement on the service side (but nothing that frequent visitors to KL would necessarily notice or mind), and ultimately nothing that would prevent us from recommending this hotel wholeheartedly.","Strategic location, but probably not for first time visitors to Kuala Lumpur",Lingkaran Syed Putra,4,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,London,2013-01-05,59200,2016-10-08 22:21

The door man were very unhelpful, not opening doors let alone greet guests. They would happily chat away at the door and ignore ypu when you push to enetr or exit. We arrived back in a car with shopping and they just stood there without offering a helping hand. I have never met such staff before at a hotel. Even cheaper ones than this.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,CT_Ng88,"The only thing 5 star about this hotel are its prices. The view from my room was of a rooftop and parking lot. Worse. View. Ever. In a hotel. I stayed there for three nights about a week ago and was shocked. There was no internet connection throughout my stay as there was some kind of problem. Fine. But when I called reception about it, I was told to come down so there could see what the problem was (despite that it was already an ongoing problem, you'd think reception would know). So I brought my laptop down to reception where I was attended to by a not very friendly personnel who made me feel like I was stupid and inept at using a computer. Basically you CAN access the internet but only OUTSIDE your rooms ie at the lobby and at the Executive Lounge. Did she tell me this? Nooooo. With a few taps she successfully connected and when I asked what I was doing wrong, she answered curtly, 'I just refreshed the page'. (Duh!). So I went back to my room and of course again no connection. I didn't find out till later that day when I complained again that it was an ongoing problem and that there was no connection is all the rooms.  The room service was terrible. When I had my room made up, unbelievably, the cushions on the sofa were in exactly in the same disarrayed positions I had left them. That was puzzling. Tissue paper box and hand towels in bathroom gone and not replaced, bin emptied but left in the middle of the entrance way to the bathroom so I tripped over it. Sheets had black spots.  Being my first time I asked the concierge if there was a shorter way to get to the GArdens Mall other than going out the main entrance and walking around the outside which is considerably longer route. I was told no, that was the only way. Later I found out there is indeed a short cut to the mall via an exit right next to reception. How is it that Concierge doesn't know this? Wow. Doorman didn't even open the door for me on a couple of occassions because he was too busy chatting with his colleagues. Breakfast begins at 6 am and here the wait staff serve you tea of coffee rather than self service. One morning I went down at about 6.15 no wait staff to greet me, fine - I don't need that but no staff anywhere else either apart from a couple of chefs. Had breakfast, no one ever turned up with any tea or coffee. Was everyone late for work that day?? Of course there were a couple of polite and helpful employees but enough unpleasant encounters to mar the experience. I stayed in the Boulevard hotel immediately prior to the Gardens and I have to say, although the Boulevard is a four star hotel, it is ten times better. The staff are professional, well trained, helpful, polite and friendly.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,yay2,"I feel that the staff manning the reception could do with more smiles and eye contacts. I find their check-in & check-out services rather curt. Our request for late check-out was not recorded in their system and had to request again when we went to validate the key card on our last day. It was a hassle as the staff that accede our request was not on duty; we also did not take down his name. We had to repeat the request a few times before the other staff finally agreed to it. She looked frustrated when she agreed. Other than this unwelcoming attitude, I am definitely pleased with the overall of the hotel. The rooms size is reasonable; the bathroom is very spacious and clean. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have slept in. They also have pillows menu.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,CardKingPJH,"Stayed in November 2012. The hotel had arranged for my taxi, higher priced than if you sorted yourself but it was less hassle.Met on arrival by the concierge who ushered me into a superbly side reception area. Check in was straight forward and took only a couple of minutes.Large room with an excellent bathroom and a massive bed. First disappointment was that wi-if signal was almost zero, ok you could plug directly into a lead provided on the desk but a 5 star hotel should have a decent signal.Typically over priced bar drinks for a 5 star hotel, the breakfast had plenty of choice but was nothing special.The hotel sat above/adjoining a giant shopping mall with many designer shops.Location was ok, just. 20 minute taxi to the KL tower and the bukit bintang shopping area, 3 in the local taxis, 10in the hotel taxis.Building work has recently started across the rod and judging by the area involved it could be a while before completionI will stay somewhere else on my next visit but would be happy enough to recommend this place.","Slightly disappointed, decent hotel but missing that 5 star feel.",Lingkaran Syed Putra,3,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Preston, United Kingdom",2012-11-25,59200,2016-10-08 22:21
Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,chezong,"This hotel advertised free wifi included in the room rate however during my stay, their internet broke down and I was disappointed that I didn't have access throughout the whole 4 days. I would have to say it's a little unreliable and disappointing and I didn't feel like I got my money's worth. A hotel should be able to fix internet problems faster than 4 days to avoid causing inconvenience to its guests. I also asked for a softer/lower pillow from Housekeeping but they couldn't understand me at all. Not very good service with minimal product knowledge. Why advertise a pillow menu when your staff don't know what that means and can't deliver. Don't expect too much from this place - it's pretty standard. Good location althou I prefer the shops in KLCC and Pavillion a lot more. I think Mid Valley is rather old now and not as appealing for shopping.

The hotel is superbly located and allowed me really easy access to central KL using taxis and the local transport system. The room was spacious and had all the amenities, the bed was prefect  providing a really good nights sleep. I would only suggest they put shaving mirrors in the bathrooms.A Duty Manager was on call at all times and when needed was responsive and actioned things with out delay and always feedback on progress. The gym was massive (size of a football pitch!!!) but, it was constantly too hot and the gym staff were indifferent to requests to turn the AC up  one responded Well I am cold. The outdoor pool was very very pleasant and never ever too busy.The executive lounge was such a pleasant place to be in, to work in and to enjoy the range of services on offer. Staff there were professional and clearly knew their job, they kind of knew when to intrude and when to keep their distance  not an easy skill.Mr Rizal Rosly is the Chief Concierge and is a member of Le Clefs dOr Society and this was clearly evident whenever he was on the desk.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Grayling7,"I stayed at the Gardens for a week in October 2012. I have no complaints. My colleague did regret not having read reviews of this hotel and not learning to ask for a room that faces the pool and disco. He was bothered by the music late into the night. (The disco is between the hotel and the residences tower, one level above the outdoor pool.) Rooms higher than the 15th floor are better. Corner rooms are larger and have nice panoramic view windows. Some aspects of the hotel are getting tired. The carpeting needs to be replaced and the upholstery removed from the walls on the meeting room floors. The hotel is showing its age, but is very nice with all the amenities I needed. The pool is big enough to swim laps in and there was never a crowd in the health club. My room was clean and attractive and the bathroom was very nice: It had a separate room for the toilet and for the bath/shower. For those who care alot about the bath facilities, the room was excellent. It had a rain shower head on the cieling, a hand shower on the wall and a separate bathtub.There are many dining alternatives nearbye since the hotel adjoins two huge malls. If you want to shop, the hotel is very convenient.

It's definitely the best of the three hotels in Mid-valley, but if you book here expecting a true five star hotel, you will be disappointed. Reasons:- rooms looking tired e.g curtains falling off the railings, shower doesn't drain well, towels are thin and worn- i saw some ants in the bathroom when I checked in today- gym is very basic, and leaks near the exercise bikes when it rains- when i got back to my room tonite at 1am, I made a simple request for a shower cap. No one turned up, and no one tried explain why they can't meet this request - despite me making a call a second time. When I tried to call the front desk, no one picked up the phone. I guess hotel service stops after midnight?- they can't accommodate wifi access for more than two devices. When I stayed in Sukothai Hotel in Bangkok, I was given access to six devices for me and my husband, since we travel with our work laptops, ipads and iphones.This is based on three stays I have had in Gardens Hotel in the past three months. Fine for a short business trip, but not for a personal luxury experience.I go on business trips two to three weeks in a month, and have stayed in five star hotels all over the world.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,AntonioShanghai,"Excellent bang-for-the-buck 5-star property in KL. Hotel is not ""Brand New"" as if opened yesterday morning, but definitely looks modern and is well maintained.Excellent quality bed and bedding, nicely appointed bathroom and shower. Speedy and FREE wireless internet (you can connect up to 2 devices per room), and flat screen TV.Decent gym on the 6th floor, with lots of space and light. Only hiccup is that there is no TV connection to the treadmills, so even if they are TV-equipped, you end up staring at a blank screen. Plenty of towels and water as needed.Good lobby bar, with a great-attitude Bartender, Miffy. She was made Employee of the Quarter, and I'm sure that if management is sensible, she will make Employee of the Decade. Yes, she is THAT good.Massive breakfast buffet with plenty of choices, and reasonable overall food quality.Hotel is a short hop away from the Airport Train Station by Taxi (10 mins), which is a great thing in traffic-packed KL.Hotel is adjacent to the upscale Green Valley Mall, with plenty of mid-range and luxury shops, and many dining options. You are not forced to hop in a taxi and endure the traffic if you feel like exploring food choices beyond your hotel's.Personnel well trained and efficient.Bottom line: A very good sensibly-priced option to stay in KL, that shows that you dn't always need to go to the big-name hotels to get a good sleep and breakfast, a quiet workout and a cold beer served with a smile.

This hotel is by no means a bad hotel, but just isn't as luxurious as some of the top range hotels. The hotel is getting a bit dated and the hallways did smell a bit humid. Overall, the rooms were clean, with both rainshower and bath. Internet through LAN cable was good, couldn't get the Wifi to work. For me, the location of this hotel worked out fine, but if I would have a choice I would stay at one of the more luxurious places.Breakfast is good and plentiful, fitness area is large with view over the surroundings (although it doesn't look particularly pretty).Likes: Location, good price, very large breakfast buffet, close to (in) the mallsDislikes: looks a bit dated, view not specifically attractive.","Nice, but just not as nice as other KL hotels",Lingkaran Syed Putra,3,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"The Hague, The Netherlands",2012-08-24,59200,2016-10-08 22:22
Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Travelling_Teddies,"Stayed at The Gardens Hotel & Residences some time last year. Before we decided to stay, we've had a preview of what the room is like previously. Friend of ours showed their room to us, and we were needless to say, very impressed. So we decided to stay here the next time we're in KL.Location is prime and perfect - away from the chaotic KL City Centre yet not quite as ""suburb"" as you think. Its in Mid-Valley and right in the heart of the mega mall, so you're surrounded with shops, cinema, food and more shops and food in any direction you turn to. So if you are looking or a roof over your head right smack in the mall - The Gardens would be one of the more ""pricier"" hotel there (there are 3 around the mall). Room - large, clean, modern concept, comfy... I love the bathroom and the enormous rain shower! All in all a great room and hotel. No frills.Bed - this is about the only issue i have with this hotel. The bed which they provided (not sure King or Queen) was ROCK hard (and not in a good, sexy way). It was so hard and stiff that we slept and woke up with a really bad back ache (which continued to hurt for weeks after). So unless you're particular about the ""cushyness"" of your bed like we did, then this hotel is perfect. Not too expensive, modern, clean and great for that ""affordable luxury"" weekend away from the City Centre.Tip: Don't bother going for the buffet breakfast if you're undecided. Sleep in and wake up to an entire mecca of food, right at your doorstep!",Decent Hotel in a Prime Location,Lingkaran Syed Putra,4,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,Singapore,2012-08-24,59200,2016-10-08 22:22

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Urban_Travellers_11,"Room was definitely spacious and interior design quality was certainly a few cuts above the average hotel room. Loved the table with recessed power point and internet cabling.Bathroom had a rainfall shower - my gripe was that it was quite hard to control the right degree of temperature as there was a delayed effect from the time you turned the knob to when the temperature adjusts. The cryptic symbol on the knob did not help matters. But this is a small complaint for an otherwise beautiful marble bathroom. Also liked the WC being in a separate compartment for convenience. For some reason despite the free wifi offered, I had difficulty logging on with both my iPad and iPhone - signals kept dropping and it was almost impossible to do any surfing. However the fixed LAN cable at least worked and I was able to use my laptop for emails and other work stuff.Parking near the hotel was quite a pain - lack of clear directions so needed to do a bit of sleuthing myself to see where the nearest carparks were. Mid Valley during weekends are packed and that goes for the carparks as well, so beware!But location of the hotel is excellent - the convenience of being connected to the mega shopping centre cannot be over emphasized!Despite the above minor complaints, this is otherwise a first class hotel and I will definitely come again!",Great room and great location!,Lingkaran Syed Putra,4,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Singapore, Singapore",2012-08-11,59200,2016-10-08 22:22

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,FreeradicalGreg,"Last week I stayed at The Gardens Hotel for 4 nights on business trip, and this is my second time to be here. I chose to stay at this hotel again.First, it is very accessible. It is connected to the one of the biggest malls of KL. You want to go KL, PJ or anywhere in the Klang Valley, the location is ideal. Right at the center.You can even take the Komuter train from MidValley mall to KL Sentral where connection to other train networks is available.Second, the hotel is simple yet very comfortable. When you walk into the lobby, there is not so much fanfare. Just simple wide open lobby which is very often empty. This is another thing I like is the not so crowded lobby. Peaceful! That's it. When I come back from business meetings and I come back to the hotel, first thing I need is peace at the lobby.Third, the room is comfortable. Again simple but practical. I always feel that at home feeling. I sleep well always in this hotel. Fourth, the breakfast is good and many varieties. It's not an extravagant spread but for breakfast, the basics are necessary and that is good enough.When I come to KL again, I'm sure it will be in this hotel be it for work or personal trip.","Simple, quite and good location",Lingkaran Syed Putra,4,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Singapore, Singapore",2012-08-04,59200,2016-10-08 22:22

Staffs were excellent except for my 1 encounter with a staff who sat at the desk beside the reception. There were no signage or indication on what the desk was for and as a customer my normal perception was that it could possibly be a concierge as it's just right beside the reception. He was very rude when I asked whether I could keep my thing there for a while. I guess he was not happy to be perceived as the concierge but as a hotel staff at least be polite and nice and customers.

There were a couple of times we got lost looking for our car as we parked within the complicated complex.Here is our feedback:1. The rooms were generally clean and well kept.2. Shower bath in the the main ensuite needs to be cleaned and mould/fungus around the bath should be removed.3. Tea towels could be provided in the kitchen area.4. The pool area/facilities could be improved in terms of making it more inviting and appealing. It was disappointing that the pool bar was not manned and not opened, that would also make it more appealing. 5. Front of house staff were generally friendly and helpful.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,cblee_31,"I stayed at The Gardens when in KL on a holiday with my parents. My father stays here regularly for business.The one downside of The Gardens is its location. It is by no means the middle of the action when it comes to KL. It is attached to two amazing shopping malls, but the complex is so big the hotel can be missed if your cab driver is unsure of where he is. It can also be difficult to drive around (in a cab) as there is only one entrance/exit when you are driving that can be blocked by the masses coming to Mid Valley for shopping.That aside, the service is the amazing at this hotel. I stayed in both the hotel and the residence. The rooms are spacious, especially the bathrooms. Breakfast is amazing. The pool is beautiful (it stretches between the hotel and the residence which are in separate towers. The staff make a real effort to get to know you. It was my father's 60th birthday on the second day we were there and there were birthday wishes from everyone, which was such a lovely surprise. We returned to our serviced room to find wine and cake for us as well. Another time I was limping with a slightly sore leg. The security man had noticed it at breakfast and wanted to know if he could help me. He spotted me shopping later on in the day and cam over to check I was ok again. The hotel really does feel quite luxurious, though it is probably more of a business hotel. Even though it is joined to the shopping malls it still feels quite separate. The executive lounge has great service, with food and drinks but on everyday for two hours with views over KL, including the Petronas Towers. With the rate we were staying on three items of laundry/dry-cleaning a day were also included. I would highly recommend staying here if you don't want to be in the heart of KL.

Bathroom is as good as a room itself, with all elegant design and paintings. Room is superb and very clean. Big flat screen TV and a nice view from the top floor. I love the paintings in the rooms. I stayed in an executive suite so check in was very fast. Lovely ladies were there to greet you and prepare your room keys. However, I noticed that in the ground floor reception area, the staff there are not so very smiling. And wifi internet and lan Internet was very slow. It is so frustrating especially I was there for a business trip. It took me long time to download my email. Overall the room experience is superb. I suggest you choose the executive premier room if you have the money. It has a nice view from the top, and the glass window is facing your bed, so waking up to the morning sunrise is very refreshing. I would love to stay here for vacation with family. Service is just average. They should smile often and should be very attentive in their visitor needs. I was in the restaurant at the 6th floor, and it took me several calls before the waiter comes in to serve my coffee and provide me with spoon and forks. Another fellow in the other table was so pissed off that he just rush to the waiters area and get his own spoon and fork.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,mulberry888,"We stayed at Gardens Residences for 3 nights in early June. We took the 1 bedroom apartment. The room/apartment itself is great. Nothing but good things to say about the room. Big, spacious, clean, comfy bed. Bathroom is huge. Kitchen is complete with all cutleries, plates, bowls, knifes, oven, microwave, fridge.However their level of service still has a big big room for improvement.My husband arrived earlier the night before and check-in. My daughter and I arrive the next day. My husband told me he had instructed the front desk to pass me the keycard. So I went up the front desk, there were 2 staff, 1 was busy with a guest checking out and thus I approached the other. The lady looked like she was talking but she wasn't holding any phone. I thought OK maybe she was using a handsfree kit. So I stood there waiting for her to finish her 'conversation'. Her mouth was moving non-stop and like mumbling. I waited for 20seconds or so and she look at me and and finally said yes? . Bear in mind she was still continuing mumbling. Finally I realised she was counting money! Come on, can't she stop counting and serve her guest?I greeted her with a Hi and told her my hubby's name and said he had checkin last night. Her reply was ""yeah so?"" Anyone with eyes can see I want to check in also because I had a big luggage with me. I had expected her to take down my name and passport. But she wasn't sure what I wanted. So nevermind, I explained my hubby left the extra card with them. After asking for my name, she just gave me the keycard and went back to counting the money notes. Firstly I find it strange she didn't take down my name and passport. All other hotels in other countries that I stayed in would do so. I thought it was required by the authorities.Secondly not a smile from her or after giving me the keycard, direct or point me to the lift. It's like she couldn't be bothered with me. Later at night we asked for extra blanket. We waited for more than 30mins. No one came thus called again and finally they said they don't have any extras.One quite small incident happened in our apartment on our last day. I got cut/pricked by a very very small piece of glass/hard plastic on my foot. It was thin as needle and about 5mm length. I gathered it was stucked in the carpet's fiber. I thank my lucky stars it was me that got cut by it coz my feet's sole skin is ermm..tough. So it didn't go all in and I could easily pull it out. I don't dare to imagine if it happen to my 3.5 years old child. Her feet sole is soft and tender and I'm sure it would go completely in.I would suggest the hotel should change it's type of carpet because it's those type which things can get stuck easily in its. Even with thorough vacuuming, I doubt it would get cleaned up.Location is great. It's connected (just beside) to Gardens Mall and Gardens mall is connected to Mid Valley Megamall. Would I stay there again next time? Probably not as I would want to try the Gardens Hotel next time.

Upon my arrival at 29th floor for check-in, they already have my details and envelope prepared and check-in was fast. Reception was polite and all smiles. When I was on my way to my room, the lady at the reception rushed to the elevator...she was literally running!!...just because she forgot to ask if I had any luggage and needed any help. That just showed that she really understood the importance of customer service.Newspaper was at my door upon arrival (early arrival). Room was very spacious, room design and deco comfortable and the lights were sufficient. Bathroom and toilet, also spacious and clean. Nice rain shower and bathtub. Large tv but I would have preferred more movie channels.Evening cocktails and snacks at the executive lounge..was nothing to flaunt about but I enjoyed it anyway because it was very quiet, good for some reading and snacks with a nice view. It's also a nice place to hang out while waiting for flight time after check-out. Another nice touch, they remembered our names with 'hi' and 'thank you' followed by a name.I had breakfast at the Spread instead of the lounge. The selection was just an ok for a 5 star hotel. I would personally have preferred a section of japanese food and a better selection of cheese. However, the service was great. Coffee arrived on time, all used plates were cleared efficiently, and the waiters were constantly greeting and smiling.Note : Taxi from Subang airport to hotel is RM30 for tickets purchased at the airport budget taxi counter. However, if you need a taxi from the hotel to airport, the concierge will hail a taxi for you. Be aware that this is a premium taxi. It costs me RM60 for Hotel to Subang airport. Premium taxis have its own advantages but comes with a hefty price.","Great hotel, great service",Lingkaran Syed Putra,5,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,Malaysia,2012-06-25,59200,2016-10-08 22:22
Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,m00lah,"Whenever we are in KL, the three mid valley hotels are always are choice with The Gardens Hotel being the 1st choice. Staying within the shopping mall of Gardens and Mid Valley megamall with hundreds of shops and food to choose from means you literally don't need to get out of the area except for visits. We have returned to The Gardens Hotel many times now and were one of the first to stay here when it was soft-launched and its pool and restaurants were not ready yet. I especially like the spacious bathroom. The swimming pool is generally quiet with an infinity edge, making it a relaxing place to be in. The cafe and gym are right next to the pool.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Gracefulgrace,"Stayed here for two nights 10 June since we are running a business meeting In the same hotel.overall was a pleasant stay.Room is good,clean and comfortable. We got a king size bed which is really comfortable.they even brought a baby cot for my two year old..Paid rm 390 per night and was given room in the lower floor. I wonder if I should have insisted on a higher floor. Room came with one breakfast. Since am staying with my husband,we have to pay extra for the breakfast. When i asked the reception how much is breakfast for in house guest,she said its 59plus plus.i saw on their website as 25 plus plus,later i asked the hostess at the breakfast counter, she told me its 58 nett. Then i tried to verify this with their banquet rep, i was finally given a 23 nett. I feel that the price irregularities is not neccessary. Nevertheless,it was great.breakfast was with great variety ,same goes with the lunch, you will be spoilt for choices. I love their choices of cheese,satay taste good ..just double check on the price too cause they advertised it as 85plus plus but we were charged 95 plus plus.

There are laundry facilities as well. I believe it was RM 10 (abt USD 3.25) per load. The only drawback was the airconditioning in the hallways and elevators were somewhat lacking and it was stuffy.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,XuNiXan,"Wanted to stay at Mid-Valley area and was recommended by a colleague. We knew that there was no free parking but we do not understand why this is so. The hotel could always absorb the fee. I was also misled by their staff that the valet parking was rm15 per entry. (so I figured that I would not be shifting my car out over the two days....its a reasonable deal). But when I checked out, it was rm15 per day (and it was stated in the terms - only that i did not read because i was misled by their staff). I did not make a big fuss and paid (my negligence...lol). We also do not like the attitude of the staffs in the breakfast restaurant.. in particular the one in the white chef suit (he look like santa with a big tummy...lol). We did not know that the breakfast was until 10 am and we came at 9.45 am. We are fine with that but the staffs were giving us the 'look' and non-welcome feeling. The 'santa chef' even said that "" and they got to come at this time"". Service from a top hotel ? Boo..!Other than that, location is great and the room is great. The pool was normal (my kids love the pool...well...they love any pool....lol) The concierge was a great help to arrange our day plan. The room service was prompt with delivering bolsters and others.Oh, another thing. They have a toilet which is chargeable at rm5 (for public) ! Clean and nice but I would never pay for it.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Kraammoz,"I am visiting the Gardens Hotel on business at the moment, and am currently waiting to move rooms at 2.45am because there is a nightclub under the hotel that is causing noise making it impossible for me to sleep - quite an achievement given I am on a high floor (above 15th floor). I -also heard these noises last night (my first night here on this trip) and was kept up past 2am on account of them. I had not encountered these noises on previous business trips on which I stayed at this hotel, but perhaps I was previously lucky in staying on the right side of the building. My even more unlucky colleague who is staying on the 8th floor tells me that he can clearly discern it is a nightclub (at my level, I only hear a subsonic intermittent booming that is nevertheless sufficient to prevent sleep) - he's planning to record it on his iPhone for posterity (and evidence). When I rang the Duty Manager he immediately said he was sending Security - at the time, I assumed he was sending Security to me, but a second call to him indicated he was sending Security to the nightclub to tell them to stop - seems like they might have this as a regular occurrence. The manager indicated that the nightclub is supposed to stop at 2am(!!). Just spoke to the night porter, who gave me the key to a room on the other side of the hotel - he said the noise is not a problem on the other side. He also noted that the nightclub noise is very bad on Friday nights (ie, worse than tonight, Thursday).

No complaints on any of the setup, which is not very usual for hotels in Malaysia. (I am MAlaysian myself).The hotel is located in Midvalley. Midvalley really has everything that you need, for a short stay. Food to shopping to entertainment. The only two issues you will encounter staying there would be,1. Access to carpark is troublesome. You have to cut through the mall, which I still find it pretty ridiculous.2. Access to anywhere else outside Midvalley shopping centre will be a hassle.

Breakfast is not too bad - lots of choices, ok quality, although it's the same everyday. I was definitely tired of it by the end of the week. I needed to get breakfast very quickly and that was not a problem. Having the mall connected to the hotel is a huge plus - it provides not only countless food options but also a place to walk around (the surrounding area is not pedestrian friendly AT ALL plus it rains ALOT, at least in December).

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,RH7PS,"For the past several holidays we have steered away from staying in tourist places and prefer to live where locals frequent. The Gardens in Mid-Valley is an ideal location for several types of travelers and I zeroed in on the hotel after extensive research and reading several reviews mainly on TripAdvisor. Over the past few years, TripAdvisor has played an ever increasing role in influencing my holiday decisions.The Gardens has several advantages. Shopping and Convenience is at the top of the list. Visiting the Times Square shops and seeing the attitudes of the retailers to tourists, made me definitely realize the great advantages of the Mid-Valley and Gardens Mall. I visited the Bang and Olufsen outlet in the Gardens and the staff was extremely friendly and happy to show me around although they very well knew I was not buying. In mid-valley too, the retailers are very friendly and helpful and give you plenty of opportunities to try out and are not put off when you do not buy. The convenience stores like Carrefour, MetroJaya and Jusco, the multiplex and the other facilities definitely make the hotels in Mid-Valley a great choice.The Location is definitely an advantage too. With the KTM station at its doorstep, for single travelers traveling around KL is extremely economical. Traveling with a family, I preferred to take a taxi and there are plenty available at all exits of the Mid-Valley complex.Coming to the hotel itself, the Check In was a breeze with the reception in the executive lounge. The rooms were very quiet and well maintained. The view too was grand. Room service was efficient and the executive lounge breakfast although with limited choice was definitely preferable for the quiet and inviting environment compared to the breakfast below. Food for vegetarians however is a challenge. As Indian travelers grow in number offering more Indian specific choices would definitely attract more Indians to the properties.The bell desk services were efficient however one of the staff left us feeling a bit strange with his ability to organize a package tour or a drop off to the airport on departure. I figured out that he was trying to pull a fast one on us rather than being ignorant of the facilities offered by his employer.All in all I recommend the hotel and the property to visitors to KL for the facilities, the convenience the associated shopping and convenience and the ease of commute to downtown KL.",Great Place that suits my holiday style,Lingkaran Syed Putra,4,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Moscow, Russia",2012-05-29,59200,2016-10-08 22:22
Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,YelloJelloSingapore,"I have stayed at this hotel at least once a year for the past few years with my family. As we are foodies n shoppers, this is one convenient hotel as its connected to the upmarket Gardens Mall and the mid-market Mid valley Mall. Of course, there are cheaper eats n shopping downtown in the Bukit Bintang area but I've always been wary of pick pockets n petty crimes in the BB area. The rooms are one of the biggest I've come across; bathrooms with the rain showers are simply wonderful; the hotel is a non-smoking hotel so one need have no worries about getting second hand smoke! I generally have no complaints about the property itself but it is showing its age slightly (like peeling wall paper along the corrider). One great thing about this hotel is that you won't encounter tour groups. The hotel on my many visits have generally been nice n quiet. Transport by cab has so far been a breeze for my family, probably because we don't travel during peak hours. I encountered traffic jams in the area around the the hotel during past stays here but this time round was surprised to find the traffic relatively uncongested. Perhaps because the season for sales have not started! There is now a taxi counter outside the lobby; staff there will hail a cab for you n even give directions to the cabbie if the cabbie isn't sure about how to get to your destination.Service of hotel staff though seems to have slipped In standard. When I arrived at the hotel, the porter was busy chatting away with a colleague. Our cab driver hailed the porter for help but was completely ignored.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,ATrenas,"The best reason for staying at Gardens is its location. It is connected to both the Gardens Mall and the Mid-Valley Shopping Center, where you can go shopping, buy necessities you may have forgotten to bring, and have a wide variety of food choices. It is also a short walking distance to the train station which brings you to KL Sentral (central train terminal). It is also close to happening places like Bansar and MontKiara, and close enough to KL proper.The hotel rooms are well laid-out. The bathroom is especially nice which has a modern and spacious feel to it, and fitted with a bathtub. All rooms are non-smoking; comes with an ironing board, iron, yukata (robe), hairdryer, small fridge, and safe.The hotel has a bar, restaurant, and room service. Compared to what you can find at the adjacent mall, prices are quite steep as to be expected. The Japanese restaurant is worth a try if you feel like splurging.The hotels location, while central, can also be a problem. During weekends and when it rains, there is heavy traffic coming into the Mid-Valley area. Taxis are reluctant to accept passengers going to this area. Similarly, depending on the hotel occupancy, getting a taxi in the morning may require some waiting time. There are actually 2 types of taxis: the hotel taxi (blue one) and the regular ones (usually red or yellow). The hotel will try to convince you to take the blue taxi; although most of them seem in better shape than most of the regular taxis, they also almost charge you double. Exercise judgment here in choosing what would work for you.When you check in, you will be asked to sign a paper that lists how many key cards you have. Be sure to check that the number reflected is accurate. Then dont forget to surrender your key cards when you check out because there is a RM20 charge for each unreturned card.The front desk staff are okay, but not particulary warm.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,LNZJ,"1 night's stay on business. Upgraded to Premier Executive for the space to accomodate my 2 kids. Paid about RM120 extra for the upgrade to a bigger room and access to the lounge and it was worth it. Room was big enough but the bath area has no particular door so practically someone could just walk into the bath area while I am in the bath tub! OK for a family but sometimes privacy is still appreciated. I checked with colleagues and apparently the standard rooms had standard doors. Executive lounge was nice and comfy but no kids below 12 allowed. Breakfast was good with the standard fair. Check-in and out was easy and quick but getting the car to the main door during working days could be a bummer, what with the heavy traffic. In fact there was a stalled car blocking access to the main entrance but all I could see were staff standing around or trying to jump-start the car. The first thing to do would have been to move it out of the way! Parking was another problem. You pay for parking according to the standard mall rate or RM5 per entry through the hotel. Try getting a space during workdays and this is nearly impossible.

But as time went by, it got worse. Service was always average - on an occasion I remember having to call the front desk 2 or 3 times for something I had requested, and there was also an occasion where the room was not made up although I had reminded the front desk in person once. While booking-wise and checking in is always very smooth, I have to say that I was very surprised that the in-room deposit kept increasing. On my first visit there was no deposit at all - back in 2010. They next asked for 100 RM, which was still tolerable. But on my last visit, the deposit required was RM500, which is a hefty sum considering that I was travelling only for a few days and had not expected to have to withdraw any more cash.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,sparky_stone,"What can you say when you are staying in a hotel that in itself is great - but the location is abysmal? Before I get to that, let me tell you about the hotel itself.As part of a giant shopping mall, the Gardens Hotel in Mid Valley City in Malaysia has all you would want from a 4 star hotel. The staff is very friendly and looks after your needs quickly and without fussing about.The rooms are modern and clean with a reasonable view. Having breakfast at this hotel is an event not to be missed. The food is plentiful, good tasting and the variety is enormous. Go there twice in the row and the staff already knows you by name.You want to go shopping? Not a problem. The Mid Valley City Mega Mall is integrated and one of the largest in the World. It kind of makes it attractive but after a while you will see there is really nothing exciting about this mall. The shops are average and if you really want a shopping experience, go to Orchard Rd in Singapore.Now for the bad (sad) part. The location of the hotel ... the street planning in Malaysia is a disaster at the best of times, but the planning around the Gardens Hotel and the Mid Valley Mega Mall really take the cake. The distance from the Hotel to the connection cross KL Sentral is about 2 minutes how the birds fly - but on a good day it takes you about 15-20 minutes to get from the hotel to the central train station by taxi (if you can get a decent one). The longest time so far it took 40 minutes for me to reach the KLIA express station from the hotel.Yes - you could take the KTM commuter train from the outside of the mall to KL Sentral - but stay clear of the train. You may be targeted by pick pockets or even get mugged.As a business traveler, you are better off staying at the Meridian or the Hilton right next to the KL Sentral Station.",Great hotel - terrible location,Lingkaran Syed Putra,4,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",2012-04-28,59200,2016-10-08 22:22

The Gardens and Mid Valley also offers 2 huge shopping centers that has a good selection of shopping and dining outlets. You will never run out of things to eat when you're there! Our favorite being Tony Romas which has the best beef ribs! There are also plenty of local food to choose from and plenty of cafes for you to sit down and enjoy an afternoon tea/coffee.

The food on offer at the time of evening drinks was to say, at best average and unappetising.Room pricing was very competitive in comparison to where I normally stay (Hilton KL) so there are a number of things to recommend The Gardens.

OK, you get the BBC and CNN and ESPN, but no other English channel. I think that as Residences are for long stay, the hotel should provide Astro Discovery package (Discovery, NatGeo, History...). Of course, be a Westerner, I also have compassion for Asians who visit our countries and must live with only one Chinese channel in our hotels (if they are lucky).- MidValley is quite congested, so getting out of the parking is a challenge as well as finding back a parking slot if you come back during daytime..","Residences, 21 days - location, service, amenities, space...",Lingkaran Syed Putra,5,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,World-wide Traveller,2012-03-21,59200,2016-10-08 22:22

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Sue_Tiramisu,"For a Malaysian point of view, the hotel's rates are on the upper scale - hence I expected above ordinary standards for the hotel.Just wanted to note that foreigners are really spoilt for choice when it comes to accommodations in KL. For about 100pounds, you'd get a small-sized room with no elevators and equally small bathroom/showers in London - but for less than that, in KL, you get a room that can easily sleep 6 adults - you can even fit a few more in the bathroom in this hotel! But that's how the world goes, I guess.This hotel is situated adjoined to Gardens Mall - a highish end retail mall - having LV, Coach, Tods, AX, Kate Spade, Lewre and the likes. The mall itself is adjoined to MidValley MegaMall - which to me, is more 'approachable' and friendly.Boulevard Hotel and Cititel Hotel are two other hotels nearby. Check in was easy - I loved the feeling of openness of the lobby. It felt so airy and huge. Room - modern deco, part laminated floor, part carpet. Lovely bed. Tv a bit on the small size but that's just a small matter. Acceptable tv channels - but having stayed in Indonesia, a 4 star hotel I once stayed in Bandung had 54 channels!Free wifi in the room, which is a nice touch - glad to see Malaysian hotels moving towards embracing free wireless internet in the room.The bathroom - now, this was luxury. It had a sink with a mirror, the usual, and also a vanity table with another huge mirror facing it. Adjoining to it was the shower and bath with another separate compartment for the toilet. Huge. Acceptable selection of toiletries. Also supplied a hair dryer and bathroom scales.Breakfast - at level six, airy, spacious, huge windows (however mine overlooked the constantly dirty Klang River - ah well, KL just won't be KL without it). Mugs were a nice touch, as another reviewer pointed out. Had the usual nasi lemak (looks like every hotel I stayed in are serving nasi lemak at the breakfast buffet nowadays) - not as nice as the one I had in Boulevard but of course the best nasi lemaks are always the ones bought at a roadside stall...!however, must rate this as the best so far with the choices it offered. I love staying in hotels - it is one of my indulgences and have to say this is one of the better hotels. You definitely won't be lacking in choices of food, what with the abundance of food courts and restaurants in both malls.I was amused though, to see a 'kacang putih' stall right smack in the middle of the megamall.....well, times sure are different nowadays.....",You get what you paid for,Lingkaran Syed Putra,5,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Kota Bharu, Malaysia",2012-03-07,59200,2016-10-08 22:22

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,AlanHathaway,"Stayed here for 10 days on a business trip to KL. Unfortunately was only booked into a deluxe room however the room was very comfortable and the view was lovely.The hotel is attached to the top end Gardens mall where you have top end designer stores over 4 floors, attached again is the mega mall which really is huge and has every shop and food place you could ask for! The hotel swimming pool is area is a must, although the pool is feels a bit chilly when you are in there its just perfect. The breakfast is not to be missed, the selection is huge, I've never stayed at a hotel where so much is served! You really can get anything from a local Malaysian 'curry' to pancakes and maple syrup. The food served in the daily spread was also a delight and compared to UK prices was very affordable. I'm already missing the food and I've just returned! I also had room service which on the whole was nice although I did have one western meal which wasn't the best (But teaches me not to order western food when the Asian dishes are perfect!).Only a few constructive comments:- The internet is hit and miss to connect to, Of the four devices I had which require an internet connection, I could only get one to connect. But it was free and quick enough. (Although I still couldn't get a VPN connection). Highly suggest that the management look at resolving this, it will push customers away who need an internet connection.- There wasn't a spare power socket which worked near the desk, thankfully my lead reached from the bedside socket but not ideal.- Lighting in the room is a bit all or nothing, a softer reading light would be nice.- Service at the daily spread and by the pool is disappointing, the staff have to beckoned for service which is disappointing. Although I noticed the same poor service in other restaurants in Malaysia so perhaps its a Malaysian thing. Once you have the staffs attention they are all brilliant. Although I think we would have spent more if a member of staff came and asked if I wanted anything else - Instead of me having to get up and go looking for a member of staff.Considering these points I'd say this is a 4 star hotel compared to western standards, so therefore its really good value.",Very Comfortable,Lingkaran Syed Putra,4,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Rochester, United Kingdom",2012-02-26,59200,2016-10-08 22:22

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,perryw,"I stayed for two nights towards the end of November, 2011 in a One-Bedroom Premier-Room, having made the booking directly through the hotel website. I had previously stayed in the hotel section of this property and decided to try out the residences section, which are the apartment-style rooms within the Gardens with a serviced-apartment concept with larger rooms designed for longer stays but perhaps with less attentive service than what could be expected in a full-service hotel. The rates were higher than at the hotel and I wasnt sure if the stay as a whole represented good value. Arrival ExperienceMy relative dropped me off from the KL Sentral station and at first, it was quite difficult to access the driveway as members of the extended Malaysian royalty like to stay here and they usually come with an entourage of cars and motorcycles, on this occasion blocking the driveway lobby access so that was quite inconvenient. No help was provided with my luggage, unlike what could be expected in a normal hotel. Instead, there was one staff member at the reception area, who was reasonably friendly but probably didnt provide the level of welcome and service that could be expected in a normal hotel. The RoomThe room was certainly very large and quite nicely appointed with a separate living area and another for the bedroom. The size was around what could be expected for a middle-sized apartment. The room had a kitchen which was well-stocked with cutlery but of course, there wasnt anything in the fridge and not much complimentary mineral water was provided. The kettle was quite large but when I looked inside, it was heavily stained at the base and effectively completely unusable and I am not sure whether the hotel housekeeping checks on the condition of some of the equipment because it didnt seem to be acceptable to have such a kettle in the room.The air-con was a split-type system which could control the two rooms individually (living room and bedroom). It was quite powerful and cooled down the individual sections very quickly but without it, the room was quite hot although it could be opened to the outside and had a balcony available. There were two well-sized LCD TVs provided in the room with a reasonable although not large selection of channels available. The bathroom had a long bathtub but was quite shallow. The toiletries were the same as those provided at the Gardens Hotel and of a reasonably good quality but the bathroom as a whole didnt seem as impressive as the one found in the hotel, although it was larger but the bathtub wasnt as large and the vanity area didnt look to be as impressive. I have videos of the room, which can be found through my profile section.Staff ServiceI didnt use the staff service much but when I did, I found it to be a little short of a normal hotel-standard and not really all that friendly. The main issue concerned the internet LAN ethernet cable which was supposed to be in the room. I called the front desk a few times but they just stated where I could find it but I searched the room thoroughly and couldnt find it anywhere. Finally, the front desk reception agreed to place one in my room but I returned later to find that it wasnt there and even after asking for a second time with agreement to place it there, it was still nowhere to be found and only on the third occasion did the staff member have it available at the reception area. At other times, the staff members didnt seem that friendly attending to my request at all so I wasnt impressed with this incident and it seemed to suggest that it fell short of what an ordinary hotel would deliver. LocationThe Residences are located above the Gardens Shopping Mall, which is a relatively high-end mall in Kuala Lumpur with the usual luxury boutique names as well as more affordable restaurants and a good food-court and eatery section in the basement. The Midvalley Mall was also next to the Gardens Mall with more mainstream shopping outlets and dining options. Apart from that, the hotel was not that well-located, being quite far from the usual tourist centres or sights in Kuala Lumpur. Taxis are readily available and I suppose there is also a train station nearby but the problem with the station is that the trains do not stop there that frequently. Apart from that, buses are also available to other parts of the city, with a free shuttle service to the Bangsar LRT station.ConclusionOverall, I thought the room was alright but probably much larger than what one person would require but the service levels here seemed to fall short and the room also was not that luxuriously appointed. I consider the Residences to be more suitable for larger groups or families who intend to stay for more than a few days. In that case, the rates could probably be justified because the facilities exist for self-catering and also the room size would be more comfortable. So, in my case, it wasnt particularly good value and I would have been better served by staying in the hotel section; I have done so in the past and overall consider it preferable for my needs.NOTE: I have videos of the room which can be found through my profile section.",Not really for a solo traveller,Lingkaran Syed Putra,3,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"sydney, australia",2012-02-18,59200,2016-10-08 22:22

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Trevor C,"My wife, two kids and I stayed here in April 2011.What a great place to stay. Centrally located and perfect for shopping, in fact right next Mid Valley and on top of The Gardens Mall. Also only a 10 minute taxi ride from the heart of KL (excluding peak hour traffic time). It's also located close to other suburbs as well, so business wise if you're in KL or the suburbs, you have the best of both worlds.The lobby area was immaculate and front desk staff were very helpful. As we booked the Club option, we checked in on the 21st floor and had the most amazing personal service.The rooms were spotless, immaculate, fully stocked with the usual amenities and equipped with the usual services. The bathroom was clean, spacious and fairly modern. The beds were comfortable and provided us with great rest.The buffet breakfast was a fullspread of both local and international delights. Not as extensive and refined as say The Westin in KL, but defintely did a great job. All the food was fresh and regularly stocked, and staff would not hurry you if you were reaching the end of breakfast time. We even had one of the staff make a barista coffee for us - though the thought was lovely, the beans let it down. But barista style coffee is not what we consider a typical Malaysian drink, so I don't hold this against them.The door men were very helpful, and always managed to ensure we got a good taxi with a driver that was not going to swindle us if we needed to go to KL city or elsewhere.There is a great pool on one of the floors, with a bar, and it overlooks the city. Great if you want to spend a day ""indoors"" and just laze around.One of the nights there, we dined at Sage, their in-house 5 star restaurant. We decided to go the full hog - 3 course, wine etc etc. Service was great, but almost to robotic like. Food was ok, though I wouldn't consider it 5 star. But it was a great effort. There are great restaurants in the two malls, so you won't have to worry about food at all.The hotel and all services are really child-friendly, so you won't have any problems here. What we really loved about the hotel (and most parents will agree with me) is after putting the kids to bed at say 7pm, my wife and I would take turns to go to the two malls/pubs. As they close at 10pm (pubs later of course), and were all right next to or below the hotel, it made it so convenient to catch up on shopping (or drinking!) that you couldn't do when the kis were awake!!All the hotel staff were so sincere and helpful and really went out of their way to help us. for example, I recall on our day of arrival, I decided to check out where the breakfast buffet area was. I was surprisingly greeted by the restaurant manager and he ran through the whole breakfast menu with me! Wow.Check out was so easy and stress-free (on Level 21 again). We were pretty sad to leave, as we had such a great experience at The Gardens. Great work guys, don't lt your standards drop.

From the lobby to the rooms. They seem to have many lights. And I was unable to dim the lighting.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,SeptemberSeven,"Located at Mid Valley, next to gardens mall and Mid Valley Mega Mall, the Gardens Hotel is your typical 4-star business hotel. I am staying there frequently and so far, I have no complaints. Check-in and check-out are usually efficient and friendly, rooms are fairly spacious, reasonably clean and feature everything a business traveller needs. Some rooms have nice views over the valley. The breakfast spread is huge and the quality of the food served is decent. I never eat lunch or dinner at the hotel as there are dozens of restaurants in the shopping malls nearby. The hotel features a range of facilities, aming them a huge gym and a swimming pool.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,MacauGerard,"Stayed at The Gardens in Mid-Valley numerous times as my company HQ is based there. All 3 hotels in the Mid-Valley area are owned and managed by the same people. Gardens is definitely the pick of the 3 and costs only marginally more than The Boulevard or Cititel. The pool is fine but currently overlooks the EcoCity construction site. The rooms are large, comfortable - some with views of the Petronas Twin Towers and KL Communications Tower in the city and the beds are super comfy. Room service food isn't too bad either, though skip the breakfast and try some of the places in the 2 adjoining shopping malls next door - Mid Valley Mega Mall and The Gardens Mall (I recommend a place called Delicious in Mid Valley Mega Mall). Free wifi is a definite plus! Its a 20min taxi ride into the town centre, 10mins from the Central Station, and perfect for shopping as the hotel has direct access to the 2 huge malls.",Perfect for Business or Leisure in KL,Lingkaran Syed Putra,4,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Kilkenny, Ireland",2012-01-16,59200,2016-10-08 22:22
Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Eddie30,"I posted my observations here in September pertaining to the deteriorating service level of the front office staff of the hotel and the fact that the said staff do not take the time to greet their guest properly. I made these observations as I have stayed in this hotel on a monthly basis for the previous 32 months.In October (Room 1705) and November (Room 1702), when I stayed at the said hotel, I noticed that the service level at the front office had greatly improved. The staff now smiled more sincerely and took the time to address each guest properly by their title and name. This is indeed very pleasing to me because it showed that the management of the hotel took seriously the feedback given by their guests. This is a marking of a great hotel that deserves its 5-Star rating.During my stay in November 2011, I noticed that the noise coming from the disco / nightclub located nearby was very irritating during the late hours (11pm - 2 am) of the night especially when I wanted to have a good night sleep. I spoke to the front office the next day and was informed that the said establishment was not under their management and as such they were not able to address the issue. I understand that it might be beyond the control of the management of the hotel but as the major hotelier in mid-valley, I believe the management / owner of the hotel could speak to the property owner to try to resolve the noise generated from the said establishment. The management need to understand that most of its guest chose this hotel for its standards and comfortable stay & sleep as they are on business trips. As such, it is important that the management give this matter some urgency to ensure that its guests continue to experience such comfort.Suffice to say that I have requested that in my next visit (January 2012), the hotel gave me a room away from the irritating noise so that I may get a good night sleep. Putting aside this issue, I am very satisfied with my monthly stay there and have since requested my office to continue putting me up at this hotel in my future business trips to KL.",A Hotel that Listens,Lingkaran Syed Putra,5,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,Malaysia,2012-01-16,59200,2016-10-08 22:22

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,deediha,"This hotel is fairly new, so the feeling is rather clean, and the bathrooms are nice and modern. The bed and pillows are not very comfortable though, and the worse part of trying to sleep is that you can hear the bass of the nightclub from downstairs over the weekend. (you might be ok if staying over weekdays). I complained at 1am and was moved to another room, which was much better, but could still hear a bit of the noise. Also traffic is very bad getting into and out of the hotel, expect lengthy delays to go anywhere in a taxi. If your plan is just to hang out at the very large mall during your whole stay you will be fine. Overall, i will stay here again, but that's only because I like to shop, and it's relatively cheap for a 4-5star hotel in KL.","New Hotel, next to the mall, but noisy nightclub",Lingkaran Syed Putra,3,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Sydney, Australia",2012-01-12,59200,2016-10-08 22:22

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,RR_USA,"THE GOOD+Concierge was professional and polite+Convenient location within a large mall with lots of restaurants+Room service food was ok, nothing special, but fine.THE BAD (they present themselves as a 5* hotel, so then I'll hold them to such standards):-At check-in I was told my reservation information was incorrect because, according to them, my reservation was 1.5 weeks later and that my reserved room-type was thus not available now. Consequently, I was asked whether I wanted a more expensive room. I told the (rather snotty) lady that her information was wrong and that I had the hotel's confirmation on my cell (which I showed). She insisted, I did as well and after calling someone, she rectified the situation and apologized. Not sure whether this was an honest mistake or some sort of scam to make you upgrade to a more expensive room.-Arriving in the room for the first time after I checked in, I found urine on the floor of the toilet. Nice!-Reception staff is not courteous at all, their attitude borders on rudeness. Aside from the check-in debacle described above, would it kill them to say ""good morning"" and ""Have you enjoyed your stay?"" when going to the desk to check out? Instead their opening line is: ""Room number?""-The reserved car to go to the office hadn't been arranged so I stood on the curb waiting for a taxi for 25 minutes. If you can't even get such things right...The other days everything was taken care of after lodging a complaint about it.-There was a considerable queue to get into the breakfast buffet. A first for me...-3 out of 4 times that I entered the hotel there was no doorman.-Housekeeping is trying hard to help with the hotel's bottom-line: used handtowels were taken away and not replaced by new ones; empty tissue box was not replaced.-All shirts send out for laundry were returned stuffed tightly in a bag.-The valet / taxi desk in the hotel has both uniformed and un-uniformed personnel. Several times, with no other option, I addressed an un-uniformed person and was left assuming that I'm being helped by a hotel employee...-Staff comes across as rather awkward / not very confident in their dealings with guests (though that may also be a cultural issue)VERDICTBoth big and small things go wrong at this hotel, so avoid it and go to the Intercon instead (or simply a Holiday Inn would be much better!).

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Depipis,"We stayed at The Gardens Hotel, not the residences. They should separate the reviews so as to avoid confusion in the reader.We booked the Deluxe room from the internet and it was directly charged to our Credit card which we found surprising as most other hotel would just use the credit card for guarantee and give us the option to pay by cash later during check out. Nevertheless it was just a small issue.We arrived late in the evening around 7pm to the hotel. I agree with the other reviewers that the traffic was horrendous. I think our taxi made 2 rounds of the mid valley before reaching our hotel. Once we arrived, the check in was smooth, probably because it was late and most guest would have already checked in. The reception staff was fast and I am glad that within 5 mins we got our room and heading our way up. The hotel is perfect for those who want to shop from morning till night because the mall is right beside the hotel lobby. There is a covered aircon linkway to megamall which you can reached within 5 mins. Food is abundance. Spolied for choice on where to eat. RoomThe room was very modern. Both me and my wife were pretty impressed and satisfied with the interior of the room. It was quite big, big enough for me, my wife and our 2 kids. The entrance was laminated wood whereas the room itself was carpeted. The LCD TV was 32"" which I find it a bit small compared to the big room. The desk chair was very comfortable and the desk was ergonomically designed. We liked the curve design of the desk because we have toddler who might bang against the drawers and because of the curve, they do not injure themselves. The lightings were great, gave a very cosy feeling and the switches are easily accessible. We really liked the bathroom so we are going to give a whole paragraph for it. The bathroom is very spacious. The bathroom also include the wardrobe which include the iron and the ironing board. It featured a full length mirror which is extremely useful. The shower area and toilet area has their own cubicle which mean whatever smell or moisture do not travel out into the main bathroom. This kept the bathroom nice smelling and clean. We specially like the shower area because it consist of a shower, rain shower and a nice decent bathtub, all in one cubicle. These cubicle are totally enclosed but are transparent glass at certain areas. This is good because the air con from the room do not come into the cubicle thus you will not feel cold while enjoying the bathtub or showering. For this, I gave the hotel a big thumbs up.BreakfastBreakfast was alright compared to the price we paid. The space was huge and the dining area is quite spacious for people to move around. The spread was ok mainly but they need to replenish the food more promptly. I had to waited for around 10 mins before one of the food was replenished. Overall, I would say, if you have time, skipped the hotel breakfast and go for breakfast at the mall or the megamall itself. I am sure there are a lot more varieties there.ServiceThe best services for this hotel goes to housekeeping. I asked for an extra towel and my request was met within 10 mins and when they do housekeeping on my room the next day, they still gave us a new extra towel and top it up with an extra hand and face towel. Very good initiative. The concierge was very helpful too. When I want to book my transport to the airport, the concierge gave option of whether to get the premier taxi or normal taxi. This is good as other hotel do not give me this option and I always have to engage the premier taxi which is super expensive. Overall, a very pleasant stay. We will certainly come again and probably will be bring our extended families as well. Definitely a good spot for hotel near shopping area.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Norhaida A,"We stayed at The Gardens Residences over the long new year weekend. We booked 3 rooms but had to wait for an hour for the 3rd room to be ready at 2pm. Found out later that this wasn't as bad as some other guests who were told that their rooms would only be ready by 5pm. It didn't help that there were only 1-2 front desk staff to help with check-in/check-out. So if it's a busy time of the year, you're in for a long wait before you are served.First impressions: Spacious, Nice set up. An adequate range of bathroom amenities. Microwave oven/oven toaster in kitchenette.After a closer look, we found that things were not properly maintained -- mould in shower area, bathtub drain stopper wasn't working, bedside lamp missing a bulb etc. When we asked for extra pillows, these were delivered promptly but without any pillowcases. According to housekeeping, it was ""a busy weekend"".The Garden Residences has no dedicated parking lots for its guests. We were told we had to park all 3 cars in the mall carpark at RM5/entry/car. As it was a long holiday weekend, there were no lots to be found and so we had no choice but to use their valet services -- RM15 per entry.Good location: It's really convenient to get to the Gardens Mall and Mid Valley Megamall -- they're just next door.",Not up to expectations,Lingkaran Syed Putra,3,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,Singapore,2012-01-03,59200,2016-10-08 22:22

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,MingHai,"My wife and I recently stayed at The Gardens from 15-17 Dec 2011 in room 1225. We heard they had a decent buffet breakfast and was a good 5 star hotel. Therefore, it came as a disappointment that so many things went wrong during our stay. On the 16th, we left at about 8:40am in the morning and came back around 4pm and the room was not made even though we had the ""make up the room"" light turned on. When we went for breakfast on the morning of the 16th at about 8:45am, there were no more tubs of yoghurt. A waiter checked in the back for me and told me they were all out. This is a very basic food item that can have lots of extras stored in a fridge. The century egg was also not refilled. The cooks handling the kway teow noodle station and the prata station were often missing. The carpets on the 12th floor were stained and not cleaned. I emailed to complain about the above matters and they blamed me for the room not being made. They claimed housekeeping records recorded my room as on Do Not Disturb when staff members went to service my room. This is distinctly false as I specifically checked the light was on ""make up the room"" when I left in the morning.  I am recommending that everyone stay at the Cititel instead of The Gardens as it is cleaner, has better service and is much cheaper.

Not because there was a queue. It was Because Joan did not do a thorough check and showed her displeasure and was uninterested in helping my guest out and did not even bother to assist my sickly guest. What a shame for this hotel. I made a complaint to the duty manager, and not much effort done to appease my sickly guest.Now here is the best part about this hotel, upon arrival, the concierge and bellhop were professional, dedicated, friendly and very welcoming.

We chose this hotel because of its great location - its directly linked to the Mid Valley Mall, which is great for those who like to shop and for those with kids. The hotel is very new - so the rooms are in good shape, unlike many Malaysian hotels with poor maintenance. The layout is nice and spacious and we especially like the bathroom design. Each time we visited we booked a room at the club floor and payed extra for it. We travel with our son, who was around 3 years old at the time of our visits. The hotel swimming pool was completely empty except for another family. Picture attached is the view from the hotel pool.The first time we were there, we had full access to the lounge facilities and the staff were helpful and friendly. We made sure that our son was well behaved and spoke softly at all times. The second and third time however, we were told that children were not allowed on the club floor and were directed to the restaurant accessed by all guests for breakfast. We were also not allowed to use the lounge with our son during the day for drinks, snacks, etc. Even though we assured them that our son would be well behaved during the time at the lounge, we were refused entry.We have decided to stay elsewhere and made it very clear to the staff that we were very dissapointed with the hotel's policy. On our upcoming trip, we will stay at the Accor Group downtown, who replied our queries and assured us that they warmly welcome children to the lounge. They have free parking as well, which is great as the Gardens charged for parking.

She said the hotel is full and no room to change for the first night but I can move to another room for second night.She also said she will call the manager of disco to lower down the music.I felt strange and confirmed again by asking, u can ask them to lower the volume? She said yes, she will call.We decided to compromise for one night. But after ten minutes the music was still as loud and uncomfortable as before. My mother started to suffer more and cannot stand up straight and needed to sit down. The pounding music makes her heart uncomfortable.I was worried. I rushed down to reception. Luckily a very nice lady who looked like a supervisor immediately moved us to level 18. This is my first stay in the Gardens. I later found out that the disco is not within the hotel but outside. How can Sia tell a outside business to turn down volume of music?She is obviously bluffing and does not take my request seriously. I believe Gardens is a great hotel but the check in staffs are the face and image of the hotel, the hotel must make sure they place someone who cares and listens to customers.",Lousy and irresponsible check in staff - Sia,Lingkaran Syed Putra,3,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,,2011-11-18,59200,2016-10-08 22:22
Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,prisannwong,"There are 3 major hotels at the next hub of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, besides the main city where you see KLCC and most of the international brand name hotels. This is Mid Valley, 20 mins away, on the city fringe, during good traffic times. With good surrounding surbubs and certain large MNCs in the area, Mid Valley (also a mega mall with international high street fashion brand names), is also a ideal location for families for shopping and business travellers who have work around that area. The Gardens Hotel is located at the Gardens Shopping Mall, a high end mall constructed shortly after Mid Valley was completed. Completely Luxury, one would expect the hotel to be the same. It is also the most expensive of the lot. On business there, the service was hard to get, the front desk only had 1 number to dial and there was always no one there. They had a special access card and you can never lose it as replacement charges are expensive. The internet access was weird. Wireless, but only 1 user at a time, so what if there was going to be a multi discussion in the room? IT geeks like us could do stuff to our comps to bypass that, but for normal business pple? And not to say, the password changes everyday, to our frustration. Also, it was so secure, checking webmails was out of the question, and email is the most important of all!. Generally, the room fittings were good, Beds were comfy, bathroom was of good size and marble all around. However, the TV selection was extremely disappointing. It consisted mainly of local channels that obviously we could not understand, and there was NO single adult like cable channel like Discovery or Nat Geo. Well, there was NHK and CNN, and 2 lousy local kids cartoon cable, but who needs that when you are serving a majority of adult work or leisure travellers? The unwinding part in the night was tough when there was practically hardly any TV to watch for real! I was travelling with my husband, who was also there for work. He requested a long time ago, for a 1 bed, but we were given twin beds upon arrival. Front desk promised that there will be available ones in the afternoon as there will be rooms checking out. After work at night, we were told there is none avail as all has checked in for the day, and upgrade is not possible despite the promise. Due to some business reason, we had to extend at the same time for a additional night and asked if they could do a small favor and upgrade us to a single bed room then. They were insistent on saying no. With the above bad customer service and general services, we will not be going back there though its alot more luxurious than Boulevard, a lower end hotel next door, at least, service was friendlier, the fittings were not any less worse, and they had proper cable and internet allowance. I am sorry Gardens, but if you want to keep good, clean customers instead of catering to your dirty, noisy PRC crowd that has already spoilt your image at the front lobby, please do something about your service procedures and really listen to what your customers really need as a neccessity.","Expensive, Overrated But Good Location",Lingkaran Syed Putra,3,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Melbourne, Australia",2011-11-16,59200,2016-10-08 22:22

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Davejlewis,I have been travelling to the Gardens for the past 3 years and rate it as one of my favourite hotels around the region. Great location - our office is in the area and have spent 3 days pretty much not leaving the mall area for dinners etc!The staff have always been very friendly and to be genuinely remembered by one of the chefs 6 months later is always a positive.The rooms are good - rain shower was always a great feature (especially coming from Oz when we had water restrictions!)Breakfast gets a bit samey after a few days but has a lot of options. Only downside is getting in and out of the area - Mid Valley traffic is crazy and have spent an hour getting thru the last 1km back to the hotel.

Had lived in KL for 4 years before, these malls are my most faves in KL. 3 supermarkets, great foods, bookstores, high end brand outlets, high street fashion outlets... The hotel itself is quite new. 2-3 years old i guess. Clean, neat and minimalist. The room is very nice. Not quite like a very luxurious one, but it is great to stay in. I didnt try the bfast. If you stays here for holidays, and no need to eat bfast very early, you have to try many kopitiam (coffee shops) or local stalls at the malls. Me love it!!

RM500+ came with a separate living area with balcony, full kitchen, king bedroom and twin size sofa bed, very practical bathroom and WC. It located just above the Garden Mall and it's neighbor Megamall or Mid Valley. It had plenty of food choices from hawker food court to high end restaurants. Crystal Jade restaurant was highly recommended. Canton-I at basement was good too. With this rate range I don't think we shall expect any brilliant service from Malaysian hotels.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Shu-Jen T,"Recent stay for a night on 25 October 2011 in room 2314. Paid a total of RM445.00 for an Executive Premier King. Check in was a bit confusing, as we were told to proceed all the way upstairs to the Executive Lounge on the 29th floor and were addressed with the wrong surname by the lady that was suppose to be expecting us upstairs. Anyway, sat across from her uneasily as she haphazardly tore up the piece of registration form that contained the wrong information and name. First impression of the room: spacious and big, but empty, dysfunctional and all in all a waste of space. Huge flat screen TV but placed on one corner of the room, albeit being in front of the bed but totally out of the way of the 2-seater couch/sofa, thus eliminating the need of even having a seating place there in the first place. Bathroom was unnecessarily huge and the shower was really slow in drainage. Water pressure was fine when using the hand shower but the rain shower lacked steady pressure. TV channels consisted of the basics, with 4 sports channels, 3 news channels, 2 movie channels, and Disney. Not enough to be entertained. Bed squeaked with every move. Breakfast was average at best with minimal selection and fair tasting food. Was told that the buffet downstairs on the 6th floor was a full one while the spread up on the executive lounge was just continental. Thank goodness we did not venture to the one upstairs.Summary: The hotel lacks concept, theme and functionality. On top of that, the service was average, especially since everyone on staff are snobbish and arrogant, seriously, like they have a stick shoved up their butt. We tried to be the bigger person and showered them with kindness but it seemed ridiculous that we paid to be nice to others. Try humility training or ask your chefs to bake your employees a nice big portion of humble pie. The whole stay was not memorable at all and sorry to say this but this hotel will not be in consideration for our next stay. Nothing spectacular, ordinary amenities and facilities, and bad service. Actually, in all fairness, was really skeptical to stay after reading previous reviews on TripAdvisor...I mean, how bad can service be in a 5 star hotel. Trust me, this is as low as you can sink, in terms of level of service.The only pro: Dressing table in the room, with a comfy stool, a hair dryer at the side, bright lighting and strategically located between the bathroom and wardrobe.Note: This is our first experience at the Gardens hotel, we have stayed numerous times at the Boulevard Hotel with satisfaction. So much for giving this so called 5 star establishment a world.

It is the perfect place to wander around in MidValley Mega Mall, with a direct access to the Gardens and its hundreds restaurants and shops.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Eddie30,"The Gardens Hotel at Mid-Valley has been my choice of stay whenever I make my monthly trip to KL. This is one 5-star hotel that really lives up to its rating. From the moment you check-in to the time you check-out you will feel that you are appreciated as a guest. What is even better is the fact that the entire hotel is completely smoking-free, and that to me is one added advantage that other hotels in KL find hard to maintain. The rooms are spacious and housekeeping is very efficient and discrete. Security at this hotel is very good and I have never had any incident staying at this hotel.One noted point is that over the last 26 months, I have noticed that the front office staff have changed regularly and the quality of their services have also deteriorated. The attitude of the earlier batch of staff that takes the time to welcome each returning guest by face and name before even registering them is gone and is now replaced by a team of front office staff who are forever looking stress and does not take the time to get to know their guests (on check-in) or address their guests by their proper title. Given that front office staff can be very stressed, it is even more important to ensure that your staff service quality attitude is up-to-mark to reflect your star rating.Thank you.",Great Hotel,Lingkaran Syed Putra,4,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,Malaysia,2011-09-29,59200,2016-10-08 22:22

I pay such a premium price for about $450 Per night to come in a hotel where the check in service area is crap and the service from the front desk office is not impressive at all.There's no superior customer services skills that make you feel like you are welcome to this hotel at all. I just touched down from a delayed flight hoping to get up to the room to freshen up before heading to the office but when I entered the lift, my key card is not working. They told me that's the way, and don't worry they will tap their card for me. So they did, my room is located at 19th Floor, but the lift stopped at 13th floor and an alarming beeping sound started and the lift stop and then going back down all the way to the lobby. Their lift is OUT OF SERVICE!It was stuck for about 15 mins and I can't wait anymore but to proceed to my meeting. I came back around 9pm, trying to get up to my room again and the SAME THING JUST HAPPEN AGAIN! I was up to 7th floor and was sent down.....I met a family who was stucked and sent back to the lobby, they mentioned this problem has been occurring the WHOLE day! Everyone was frustrated and there's about 5-6 guest waiting at the lobby. I am very dissapointed and request them to moved me to The Garden Hotels instead, but the front desk manager is absolutely not helpful enough, just tell me is all FULLY booked! There's no apologies for the trouble what I have to go through and he just ignore my complaint and smile it off even without looking at my eyes and speak to me.I am TOTALLY dissapointed with this hotel and I will never recommend this service to my colleague, friends or family that visit KL in the future.

I click through the normal route, saw that the price was the same and assumed that I will get the promo advertised, but the insisted that I needed to click through the promo banner when I checked in. I find that a bit stupid!Other than that, we had a blackout during one of the nights, called maintenance, didn't come, needed to called again, then they came. They had some faults with their electrical system, where after a power cut, even after the power had resumed, the power didn't come back to the room. This was immensely uncomfortable, as I had a young child with me and having to do maintenance in the middle of the wee hours is troublesome. I made a complaint afterwards when I got back to my home, and they were generous enough to refund me the charges for that night.

I was totally disappointed but nevertheless accept the terms. I urge all family to check before booking a hotel. Most hotels allow children into their lounges but as parents we have to make sure our children are well behaved.The recent stay is just 1 week ago. My current trip was just for shopping.

In this age of technology, my family are all using smartphones. My brother and I have to take turns to log on and off. WIFI is not available in the rooms as well....WIFI is only available in the Lobby and Lounge.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,JasonGAAA,"This was a while back so I'll tell you what I vaguely remember.I booked an Executive Premier King suite. Check in was done on the top floor where the Executive Lounge was located. This is where the disappointment started. The staff handling the supposedly ""higher end"" guest cannot even hold a proper conversation in English. Friendliness was 6/10 if I were to rate it. Kinda got me wondering why I bothered paying extra for ""executive"" privileges. Might as well have checked in from downstairs where the masses were and got it over with.The room was situated in the corner of the hotel which created sort of an awkward shape if you ask me. That of course, I can live with. It was spacious, as promised but definitely not luxurious by any standards. The best I will say is that the bed was comfortable and the room was generally clean all round.Breakfast at the Executive Lounge was a joke. The variety offered was poor. There was hardly any service. So much so that both my wife and I decided to go down to The Spread to have a second round of breakfast. Again makes you wonder why you paid the extra right?

We always stay at the Executive rooms that entitle us to the lounge. The rooms whilst relatively small, are well maintained. The lounge is a good place for us to go to get some peace and quiet with some evening canapes and wine. The best part of the The Gardens would have to be the breakfast at The Spread. The buffet breakfast has Malaysian, Chinese, Nyonya kuih, Western food and we often find this to be the highlight of our stay. We also enjoy the vibrancy of Midvalley Shopping Centre.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,perryw,"I revisited this hotel for two nights in mid Nov. 2010, this time making the booking through Asiatravel for an executive premier room.Arrival The porter service and greeting at the hotel could have been better, as there was no assistance provided with the luggage and no assistance to or from the executive lounge on a higher floor via lift, which was where the check-in took place. Also, I was not told which floor the lounge was located but managed to find the level while in the lift.Once I arrived at the Executive Lounge, the welcome was better but only after I was recognised as a returning customer. At first, while being let through the glass doors, the lounge attendant didnt actually seem that welcoming but then apologised by stating that she had thought I was from mainland China, which I considered a very odd thing to say at the time. Upon further analysis, she appeared to be saying that she would not welcome nationals from the Peoples Republic of China in an equivalent way to other nationalities, which on reflection did not appear a very appropriate or professional attitude to adopt if working in the hospitality industry. So, the hotel really seemed to need to work on its welcome a little more.The RoomI was assigned a corner room, which was very large and had large floor-to-ceiling windows looking out over the immediate surroundings. The ceilings were very high which contributed to the sense of space and the room had large areas which were not filled in or cluttered with furniture and so it was an easy area in which to move around. I have a video of the room which appears on the link in my profile section.Unfortunately, the wooden floor was looking a bit worn, which was not the case in my previous stays but otherwise, the room still looked in good condition.The bathroom appeared quite similar to that in the deluxe rooms but seemed perhaps to be slightly larger. The bathtub itself was of a simple but functional design so overall it was quite good but it did seem to be a little small with not as much depth as other bathtubs which Ive experienced.The shower also followed the simple and thus easily functional design philosophy so it was also pleasant to use.Common Areas/FacilitiesI had breakfast twice in the executive lounge, which was a pleasant and quiet area early in the morning. The selection was quite limited but I could have taken breakfast in the main restaurant area. The executive lounge area was quite large and spacious, as well as being quiet early in the morning and later on in the late evening. The gym was large and airy with good expansive views but the range of equipment was quite limited although still enough to give a good workout.ServiceLaundry was one of the main issues I encountered. My room rate stated a non-accumulative total of three pieces per day could be laundered and pressed. I asked the housekeeping department for permission for five pieces to be laundered on the one day, with no further laundry items following and at first they didnt understand the request but then they said to fill in the form, which was later returned with a full charge and no indication of the laundry being complimentary. The issue was cleared up by the executive lounge who were quite helpful in solving the misunderstanding.The checkout attendant in the executive lounge had a very pleasant disposition so it was a good way to leave after quite a good stay.ConclusionOverall, the hardware in the hotel remained quite pleasant and I was still happy with the wooden flooring and decor design. The service was generally good and it was another good stay but due to the odd hiccups such as having no welcome or assistance in the hotel lobby to the odd initial attitude of the executive lounge attendant, I think the stay this time fell slightly behind expectations when compared to my previous stays.",Slight but workable issues,Lingkaran Syed Putra,4,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"sydney, australia",2011-07-27,59200,2016-10-08 22:22

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Bungan,"We stayed at The Gardens for a short weekend break from house and kids.My husband and I stayed at the Executive Premier Room- around RM500/night.The moment we arrived, no one were there to tell us where to go. We waited/queued and finally being told to go up the lift to go to Level sumthing (can't remember).We arrived at the mentioned level- and headed towards the lounge. We could not open the door as someone from the inside had to open it. There was noone at the reception table. But we could see guests inside eating though. There was no bell-so we just waited outside for more than 5 minutes. Kinda looked stupid with all the things outside their glass door-and waiting outside. When we paid a huge sum of money for a room-we expected promptness. Then finally they saw us and checked us in. I am not sure if there were facing shortness of staff on that particular day or they are just like that.We went for the cocktails served from 4/5pm to 6/7pm (can't remember what time exactly). The lounge was huge but so-so. The one thing that spoiled our mood eating was because there was this guy wearing clothes that you only wear in your bedroom, and with your feet folding on the sofa. Food was okay. Complimentary alcoholic drinks were served too. The staff were friendly.The room was okay-just boring. Probably it is meant for business, I don't know. There were no colours, just brown. Bathroom was good. Toilet and shower had separate rooms. Food for room service was quite a variety-quality just okay. The plasma TV was huge-we brought our own laptop and HDMI cable to play out some movies. View from the room was boring.We had our breakfast at Level 6. There were quite a variety-not bad. However it was packed. By the way, there is a restaurant called The Sage in the gardens. But you will have to do early reservation by weeks? Usually they do not entertain walk-ins. But food was really very good. Kind of like fine dining. Suitable for couples.. no kids please. But expensive. Can check out their website though.We were allowed to check out late as it was not a busy weekend-which was good!Checkout process was really annoying. The reception at the lounge was entertaining a foreign guest so we were told to go to the ground floor for checkout. I noticed that there were 2 computers at the counter but only one was actually doing all the checking in or checkout. So we went down and queue up like all the rest! And there were many people and slow....

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,DebuDeb,"I stayed in Gardens Hotel in Kualalumpur in first week of June. My overall experience in this hotel wasnt very good. My check-in process took a lot of time and I found the front-office executives to be indifferent. These staff members seem to be doing a job which appeared as if they were forced to do. There were no smiles, no good morning, no thank you.The room that I stayed in the 21st floor was large & the cleanliness was satisfactory. The room had all that is required for a business traveler or even a tourist. One observations that I wanted to make was that the toiletries provided were sub-standard. I found the packaging to be pathetic. The shaving rajor appeared to be from some unknown source. I tried using it but in vain  clearly showing the quality of these stuff. If asked something from the housekeeping twice and took a lot of time. I did use their coffee-shop a couple of times. Here too the staff members were quite indifferent. Clearly this hotel needs to invest in training the staff on how to interact with guests. I had a terrible experience with two front-office executives on two different occasions. Their names was Kumar and Harwinder. I requested Kumar for a 15 mins late check out which he refused and this he did in a pretty rude manner. He even did my billing while checking-out, the process took 20 mins and all along there was a frown on his face. When I complained to Harwinder she said she could not do anything about it as all individuals are indifferent.Earlier I had spoken to Harwinder twice for some details about KL. But I found here to be too rude.

The bathroom is spacious - they have a seperate rain shower and bathtub. The proximity to Gardens Mall and Midvalley Megamall is a big plus - a great excuse to watch a late-night movie! The staff are friendly too. For a hotel right smack in the middle of daily heavy traffic, it is a quiet hotel.If you are driving, make sure you call the hotel to ask them where to park your car closest to the hotel. Even for people who frequently go to Midvalley Megamall (yours truly), this is a tricky bit; if you park at a random space you will take some time to reach the hotel and vice versa. They do not have free parking for guests but they do have a flat rate.The breakfast buffet was nice for local food but not so much for the Western fare, in my opinion. The location of the buffet (a restaurant called The Spread) is gorgeous -- it has large windows which you can sit by and gaze at the clear skies (which so happens on our trip). I like the mugs they have for coffee/tea instead of the regular formal cup - it felt very homey. The decor was in orange - very cheerful ambience.For Muslim travelers and those who need to go to toilet with water, the lack of hand bidet can be a downer. Usually I don't mind this at other hotels, but because the bathroom itself is big with the toilet having a seperate cubicle, it gets a bit tricky during emergencies.

The size of this huge service apartment was wonderful for a huge get-together of friends and relatives, the 180-degree view was great. BUT there were many minuses: The service is spotty, inconsistent, and sometimes downright frustrating. The front-desk receptionists made mistakes in our room reservations regarding our order of the extra beds--we had this ongoing issue with them, and each staffperson would say something different, like insisting we haven't paid for the extra beds (which we already did, through our online travel agent, and we even had our invoice to prove it). It's very frustrating to be questioned about this daily. Also, room service was extremely stingy on towels and toilet rolls. How can you give four towels and two toilet rolls when there are seven people? It was our daily morning call to to get these extra items. For their high price and name, this hotel falls far below the standard of even a cheaper motel. Now, the location: At Mid-Valley Shopping Center, the Residence can be great for shoppers, but it's a nightmare to get to and from, especially on Fridays and rainy days. Be prepared to be stuck in two-hour traffic jams trying to leave the area! So choose this hotel with care--it's great if you want to stay and shop just in the area (and if you can take the questionable service); if you want to get around KL quickly and easily, plan your stay for non-Friday stays and hopefully sunny nonrainy weather.

Plenty of food options in the hotel - although ' The Spread' is overlit and a bit sterile. Loads of eating options in attached malls. Very6 strictly non smoking - a quick trot through the mall or standing by the road is required so if you are a keen smoker give this hotel a miss - plus is of course it doesn't smell of stale smoke anywhere. It is attached to the Mid Valley Mega Mall and upmarkert Gardens Mall - huge with any shop one could ever desire and then some. The Kommuter Mid Valley train station is accessed through the Mega Mall - 5 mins to KL Sentral for RM1 each way - bargain but avoid 0730 to 0930 and 1630 to 1900 as just too crowded - and note the middle of the three cars on the train are for ladies only at all times. Taxi (coupon system to avoid rip off taxi antics that prevail in the city) RM12 from KL Sentral. Nothing within walking distance apart from said malls. Staff friendly and effective. Don't plan on going to KL again as did not like it at all, but the hotle was probably the best aspect of the stop there. Be careful whenusing taxis - one attempted to overcharge me RM376 for what was a RM15 at the most trip ont the basis that I got in at Petronas Towers and that was therefroe a special journey - a suggestion that we seek a second opinion at the police station saw a quick back down on his part. Be careful and strong willed - report this type of activity. KL has a few sights - Petronas Towers are impressive, some great temples, and Chinatown is atmospheric if too full of people selling tatty fake goods. Main attraction seems to be huge shopping malls though - great if this does it for you, less attractive as a destination otherwise. Transport system not well intergrated but very cheap - monorail worth a ride.","For Non Smokers ONLY Great rooms, good facilities and well connected to the centre - great for shoppers",Lingkaran Syed Putra,4,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Brighton, United Kingdom",2011-03-18,59200,2016-10-08 22:22
Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,civetta11,"Just had an unpleasant 2 night-stay in this hotel on a business trip and had one of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had (I travel regularly on business around Asia). I had chosen this hotel solely because of its location, my business partner's office is within walking distance across from the Gardens Mall. However, I seriously regret choosing this hotel over one that is further away. The hygiene standard of my room was frightening, there was a pubic hair in the bathtub, a hair in the drawer in the wardrobe (cling to the plastic laundry bag), another hair on the desk; the bathroom mirror had white spots all over (splashes from a previous room guest brushing their teeth), the second mirror at the entrance has also not been cleaned (this made me wonder if ANYTHING had been cleaned); towels were old and grey with threads fraying at the sides (this hotel has only opened for 3 yrs), the carpet of the room looked filthy and the shower was a nightmare - it was either all hot water or all cold water. I could not even take a proper shower and this hotel claims to be a 5 star establishment. I agree with the previous reviewer regarding the rudeness of the staff, I asked for directions to a bureau de change and was told just to go down the escalator and without any other further instructions. I went down the escalator and ended up in a carpark. When I went back tot he hotel to ask again, she repeated 'just go down the escalator' and then sarcastically scoffed at me as if I was an idiot for not understanding her directions (in fact you have to walk to the centre of the mall where there is another escalator for going down stairs where the bank was). At breakfast when I asked for a glass of Apple juice as I was in a hurry so I didn't want to get up to the buffet to get it, the waitress hesitated and was obviously not happy with my asking her to get something I should get myself; in the end the manager passed by, saw what happened and got me the juice.I was so appalled that I filled in the Comments Card and handed it to the reception in the morning. In all fairness I got a letter from the GM promptly on the same day acknowledging the issues with a room change arranged. I was upgraded to an Executive Room which was in fact, identical to the previous room but 6 floors up with Exec Lounge privileges (which I could not enjoy as was checking out the next morning). The shower was the same and I put up with another evening of cold shower. The next morning I have never been more glad to check out of a hotel.",Avoid at all costs,Lingkaran Syed Putra,1,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,London,2011-03-17,59200,2016-10-08 22:22
Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,tony-kl,"After booking specifically for a weekend stay on the executive floor / lounge and booking the premium, large room at full rack rate plus cost of extra bed to accommodate our 2 kids (9yrs and 6yrs) we encountered some of the rudest and stupidest management behaviour I have ever had in a hotel.We frequently travel through Asian cities with our kids and always book the executive or business floors for weekend stays because they are usually empty on weekends and we get great service and really appreciate the additional lounge facilities services. In 10 years we have never had anything but a great experience, including in Gardens the last time we stayed there a couple of years ago.However, I assume the management of GM has changed. After being rudely informed that our kids were prohibited from the executive lounge (despite having accepted our booking) we repeatedly asked to see the Manager to discuss the matter more reasonably. He never came to see us...although we continued to use the lounge we were meed to feel decidedly unwelcome and our treatment was generally surly and unfriendly.... including a visit to the lounge by one of the staff claiming ot be head of security asking us to remove the children from the lounge THERE WERE NO OTHER GUESTS IN THE LOUNGE at the time....we again asked to talk to the Manager...no sign of him.On top of that, we were surprised to have limited access to wifi (only 1 password per room occupant) in the lounge where usually in 4 and 5 star business hotels are more accommodating and sensible.From a previous visit a year or so ago where the staff went out of their way to be helpful and friendly to our more visit this weekend where all efforts were exactly opposite WHATS HAPPENED at the GardensTotal DISASTER and exceptionally unpleasant experience...can;t believe I paid top dollar to be treated so rudely.",One of my worst ever hotel experiences,Lingkaran Syed Putra,1,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",2011-03-06,59200,2016-10-08 22:22

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,AltanSG,"The hotel is acceptable though the initial room had a leaking sink, thus the toilet was almost flooded when we first got into our room. Regrettably, it is the valet company which they utilied, has tarnished their reputation forever. Not only they are irresponsible, but the manager is rude and offensive.Our Malaysian friends had kindly sent us to the hotel and park at the alighting area, where the valet service operates on the same counter. Upon informing the bell boy that we are checking into the hotel, he informed our friends to pass the car key to the service personnel at the counter for safe keeping. After checking in at the concierge, our friends assisted us to bring our luggage to the room before leaving. As we approached the counter to retrieve the keys, the valet service staff informed us that we have to pay the charges for parking the car at the hotels alighting point. This was not prior advised by the bell boy thus we told the valet staff that we are hotel guest. The valet staff then called her manager, who came to us and after our explanation, insisted that if we do not pay, we will not get our keys, before walking away.Shocked by his rudeness, we informed the concierge manager to handle this, who spent about 20 minutes talking to the manager before he released the keys. For this, we will never choose the hotel again, as well as our all Malaysian friends and colleagues, if they continue to use this valet company.",Please Change Your Valet Service,Lingkaran Syed Putra,1,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"Singapore, Singapore",2011-01-04,59200,2016-10-08 22:22
Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Screensilver,"Having stayed in Penang for eight days I was hoping to stay in the Traders KL for five days, but the price was just a little too steep, despite the Guest Relations officers in Traders Penang trying to get me a good deal, but it wasnt happening. After a quick search on the internet I found a deal for the Garden Hotel & Residence KL in the Executive Deluxe Room. Although, I had booked all my flights, plus Thai and Penang Hotels months ahead I was hoping for any last minute deal for only five nights in Kuala Lumpur. Upon my arrival at the Garden Hotel and Residence you have to check in on the 29th floor. This is a new property on top of a shopping mall, very handy for shoppers. Our first impressions were very positive; we had a room on the 27th floor, which was up on the club floor. The style of this room was a modern design, bright bold colour scheme and lots of wood. The room offered a great view over the city, facing the Petronas Towers in the distance. On top of this we could get three items of clothes cleaned every day.This hotel was not in the heart of the city, but KL is certainly not California or Tokyo, so it was easy to get around using the Rail system, and Mid Valley train station is only one stop into KL Sentral. Upon arrival we had a couple of minor niggles, first the keyless lock started playing up would not close properly, someone came straight away, then some of the electrics went, in our room but I reported this to House Keeping and went out for dinner and when we came back it was all fixed. But following that, we had no further problems during our stay.The bathroom was good with plenty of glass and to be honest there was no issues with water running over the floor or damp smells whatsoever. If I had any problem it was the toilet door that occasionally would stick. This was a heavy laminate shatterproof door, and I imagine because of the weight would shift, as the hinges drop, I reported this.Breakfast offered a wide choice of western, Asian choices on offer and yes as a popular hotel it was quite busy at times. Contrary to what has been written the tables were not dirty or filled with dirty plates. In our five days we never observed this apart from when a guest had just left the table and then someone else would rush to go and sit at the table before hotel staff had a chance to clean it. This being Asia we never, apart from breakfast, had a meal at the hotel or drank in the bar which seemed to be busy every time we passed.Every morning I used the gym, which had outside members or it could have been people from the residence using it. But this was a nice modern well spaced out place with modern equipment. It was not busy at 6.30am when I was using it; my only issue in a modern place like this, there was no sauna or steam room but did have an outside swimming pool with great views. I didnt find the changing room small at all, I have seen smaller. But whoever designed this area should really have put in a sauna and steam room.This a great hotel for people that like shopping, although the shops here are mainly the types I can easily find in Europe, not much by way of local products. Even Borders Books which surprised me, since they had closed many of the branches in the UK. On the ground floor of this mall were many shops that specialised in catering to serious womens pampering, my wife kept disappearing down there for hours.The club lounge was open from 5-7pm for snacks etc, but as I would busy catching up on TV content, on my laptop, that was I watching on the TV in the room via HDMI (sad I know, but this is one of the few times I can catch up on whole TV series). I asked the wife to bring me a coffee on her return. Staff would not let her take one coffee down for some reason, I went up to ask why and they said all food & drink had to be consumed there. This was a bit strange and odd, I am not sure what they thought was going on here whether they were under the impression I was having a party in my room and was sneaking the odd coffee and cookie to another guest, not entitled to such worldly pleasures. On customer service, both the wife and I found the hotel staff polite, responsive to our requests, and helpful. As it was my birthday on one of the days I was there, I was surprised to come back to my room to find a birthday card and cake, which was a pleasant surprise. I have read some of the negative accounts about the staff being not too helpful, but to be honest apart from not allowing us to take a coffee back to our room, I have no complaints about the staff. On common sense when our cleaning was returned, I have been in hotels that just leave these on the bed, here this was placed in the walldrobe.When checking out this was effortless, to be honest although I checked out in the main lobby, and not in the club lounge as I could not be bothered to go up to check out then come down. I asked for a taxi to take us to KL Sentral so we could take the Express Rail Link to the LCCT airport, for our Air Asia flight back to Bangkok. On checking out I reported the heavy toilet door that would occasionally get stuck and other minor suggestions.Overall a for the price, this represented great value at a hotel that was convenient, as we made much use of the metro Mid Valley, which we could get to, walking through the malls or out of the hotel and walk down to the station in five minutes. When I was checking in, I was asked if I had stayed here previously, I said I had stayed in the Plaza the last time I was there and that was in May 1990. And as I was leaving the they were preparing for a ASEAN Summit and this hotel was not yet built along with the Petronas Towers, railway and many other buildings. Anyway I would certainly recommend this hotel  especially, if the price is right!

Even the lighting doesn't make the rooms more appealing.

The wardrobe is located in the walk-in bathroom area (yes, no doors to the bathroom! Only glass doors to the shower and frosted glass door for the toilet--embarrassing if you happen to have a guest in your room when you need to shower or something like that! No idea if the twin-bedded rooms are similarly arranged though.)The way the bathroom is designed it makes the most of an otherwise cramped space HOWEVER it is not recommended if you are sharing the room with a friend (no privacy!)There are other design flaws for the bathroom, which is otherwise nice and modern: the glass door to the toilet opens only to the inside of the cramped toilet stall, there are two showers in the separate bath area BUT they are both controlled by the same taps, i.e. it is not possible for two persons to use both showers separately at the same time (the bathtub does not have a shower).Location: many people have commented that this hotel is centrally located. Yes and no. Yes, if all you want to do is shop and confine yourself to The Gardens/Mid Valley Megamall.

I booked for 2 nights in July for the sake of my teenage son to move around the mall & to meet his friends there.This hotel is less than 3 years but the carpet in the room is dirty & desk top is stained.Went out the following day at 10am & returned to room at 2pm, imagine the room is not tidy yet that I had to put the ""Pls tidy my room"" board on my room door for attention.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,littlewind20,"I was back again to The Gardens last weekend. The room and cleanliness are great. However, i would strongly recommend the management of the hotel to look into the parking issue for the in house guest. We had a very bad experience to find a parking space through out my stay of 4 days 3 nights at The Gardens. It really inconvenient the guest. Maybe the management can allocate and reserve parking space for in house guest and i believe the hotel will ensure the convenient of the guest at all cost!!

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,jma24,"What an awful place this is. The hotel is covered by mountains of wooden veneer, which is a great metaphor for how it feels to be a guest. This is a hotel which cares about appearances and so-called standards, but which doesn't care about how customers really feel.Yes, it is right on top of the Gardens mall, which is a great place to shop. If that is important to you then this might be an OK place to stay. But there are many reasons why this is simply not a five star hotel.First is the reception and taking of calls. My callers have complained that it takes 20+ rings to get through so they can connect me to the room? Hello? I'm not looking for a personal secretary but there are some basic standards. I don't do credit cards so they made me pay up front (fine) and couldn't take a deposit so have made me pay cash for everything else in the hotel (not fine). I've been all over the world and never seen anything like it.Second is the staff inside. This is a five star hotel. I want to be made to feel that every need of mine is a simple point of reality that they want to help me resolve. Instead, I struggle to communicate with them and they appear to have no interest.Third is the taxi rank. Why do they imagine that it is OK to stick taxis outside that charge 2-3x the going rate. And who won't go on the meter, and try to barter overcharged rates that are 5-10x the real rate? That's not OK.Fourth is the room. It's covered with veneer wood but really not all that. The aircon won't turn the room up above 18 degrees and it is as dry as a bone in there. I had my contact lenses on for 30 minutes and they dried up and had to be practically chiselled off my cornea. And 5 minutes after I got there, they came in the room and locked up the mini bar. The next morning, they took away the bottle of water that I hadn't drunk in the room.Fifth is the food. It's a five star hotel. It's not too much to ask to want somewhere to eat at 11pm. Instead there is a canteen restaurant with poor 1* food on offer. They sent me to a ""fine dining"" restaurant which looked like a building site and was full of grumpy people who told me it wasn't open. Seriously.Sixth is the breakfast. I've had better breakfasts in a Quality Inn or Premier Travel Inn. I was nothing less than disgusted by what the breakfast had in store for me. The sheer volume of people and rush of what was going on. The table I was asked to sit at which was already allocated to someone else. The next table i was asked to sit at that then had 3 other people try to sit down with me. The need to walk all around to find a plate and to ask three times to get a coffee. The tables that were left in a mess for 20-30 minutes at a time. The empty bowls of syrup and meat mixed up with eggs and vegetables. And on it goes.Seventh is the internet. No wireless access in the rooms (don't they know that a lot of devices don't even have a network connection?) and a wired connection which is 12"" long and constrains you to a point on the desk. And which downloads email. Eventually. Opens web pages. Eventually.So if you need to go to the mall, or you have a desperate need to be in this area, then pick this hotel, it's better than nothing. But a five star hotel it is not. Caveat Emptor.",Let down by a thin veneer of paucity,Lingkaran Syed Putra,1,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,"London, United Kingdom",2010-07-25,59200,2016-10-08 22:22

The hotel provides a laundry service of 3 free items a day, and your washing is returned as if it had been dry clened ( wish I had this service at home), impeccable service, Very friendly staff.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,side11,"My wife and I stayed in this hotel as a base for some household furniture shopping for a flat we have bought in KL. We have also stayed in the Boulevard Hotel, next door which is the sister hotel of this one (see one of my other reviews).We stayed in an executive suite on 12th floor (#1214). The room was spacious, clean with a comfortable king size bed and free internet access (no wifi in room though). Breakfast could be had at the executive lounge on 29th floor or in the all day dining room on 6th floor. We preferred the 6th floor because of a far greater selection of food (including roti canai etc). However, it was very crowded towards the end of the breakfast period (10am) - long queues to be seated - and the staff really did start taking away the breakfast buffet food at 10am, during weekdays at least. The executive lounge was much more peaceful and open until 10:30am but the buffet selection was much more limited and the staff were rather slow in replenishing it.There is a Japanese restaurant on the 7th floor. We ate there once and found the food choice to be rather limited and quite expensive (no sashimi, by the way). The food was OK though and if you need a quick decent meal without needing to go too far (as we did), it will work. Was able to watch World Cup games in the bar of this restaurant and also, surprisingly (for me at least), a rugby international between England and Australia. Bar staff were helpful and friendly. Gym was OK but rather limited equipment. Very spacious - it seems they are waiting to put more weights and other equipment in it). The swimming pool was nice and satisfactory for doing lengths. I was surprised to be ""turfed out"" at 7pm one evening. I'm not sure whether that is a general rule or whether they just needed to do maintenance.The hotel is very convenient for Megamall and the other more upmarket mall next door - you just walk out the back of the hotel on the left of the reception. There are other restaurants in the malls (which seem to close at 10pm). All in all, a good comfortable hotel. It is similar in quality to the Boulevard next door although perhaps marginally better. I would hesitate to describe it as 5 stars though - closer to 4 or 4 1/2 stars.","Good, solid hotel",Lingkaran Syed Putra,3,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,Hong Kong,2010-06-25,59200,2016-10-08 22:22

That's the strongest point of this hotel.Room is quite spacious. The decor is simple and modern. However the moment we stepped into the room, we smelt something weird. We found that the culprit is the room carpet. We seriously think that the hotel should clean the carpet more frequent as it stinks!There is a 32"" LCD tv that comes with very limited TV channels. LAN internet is provided FOC, good for business travelers. The bed is not as cozy as Sheraton Imperial KL's (sorry for making the comparison but we had just checked out from Sheraton Imperial before checking in this hotel), but at least it's clean =)The toilet is very clean and well lit. You get a big bath tub, a rain shower next to the bath tub, a trendy basin (but not so practical as it's kinda shallow and small), a toilet bowl that is hidden away.Overall, it's a good hotel with very strategic location.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,macaron91,"I booked an Executive Premier room at this hotel, as a overnight transit stop before catching a flight to Bali for my honeymoon. We arrived and was immediately taken to the Executive Lounge to check in. Quick efficient check in. I informed the staff that we were checking out at 630am as we had a flight to catch at 930am. We also requested for a taxi at 645am to take us to the airport. The woman at the front desk smiled and said she will sort it out. She said we'd have time for breakfast at the Lounge as they start serving at 630am.We went to our room and inserted the keycard into the slot....NO ELECTRICITY! The room was warm to the point of stiffling, thankfully the bellboy came up soon after and called for help. He came back to inform us that the electricians are coming...in TEN MINUTES! It would have been so much more convienient to give us another room, but nope, we had to wait until the electricians fixed whatever was wrong. Finally, it was sorted, and only the bellboy apologised. We did not receive any apology from the Front Desk. Early the next morning, we packed and took our suitcases ourselves to the Executive Lounge to check out and grab a quick breakfast. The front desk was not manned and it was already 630am. I waited for 5 minutes and called the Main Reception. The woman who answered replied, ""The Executive Lounge is not manned until 7am."" I got upset and said that I was not informed of this when I checked in yesterday. I asked them if they could send someone up to sort out my check out. She replied she had to ask her Duty Manager. She comes back and again reiterated that the Lounge is not manned until 7am and asked if I could come down to the regular lobby to check out! What is the use of paying for ""Executive"" services when you get none? I informed her that we were having breakfast up here and we wished to check out now. She finally said ""Would you like us to send someone up?"" OMG! It finally clicked to her what I wanted! No apology whatsoever. Soon enough, a man was sent to deal with my check out and that went okay. Again this man stated, this Lounge is not staffed till 7am usually. I became upset with him and blasted him for the so-called executive services! I wrote the complaint on their feedback form.Finally all was sorted and we went down to the front of the hotel, expecting the taxi we had booked at 645am. Guess what, the taxi wasn't there! I told the bellboy my flight was at 930am and we really need to get to the airport soon. Had to wait until they find a taxi. The taxi finally arrived, only for the taxi driver and the bellboy to have a nice chat for a bit before leaving.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,deo68,"We've been here 3 times before, once in Club (Executive floor) and twice in the regular rooms. After the 1st stay in Club in Dec 2008, we decided not to waste the money. The food selection in Club was poor, cookies were stale, drinks limited and staff friendly but amateurish. I've had much better - alcohol on demand, Haagen Dazs ice cream free flow and high quality food and drink in an ambience of peace and seclusion. Nonetheless we like its location in Midvalley and the access to food and shopping.Regular rooms were exactly the same as Club rooms except that we didnt have access to Club floor. Having faced the awesome hordes at Breakfast - queues 20-30 people long, food not topped up and plates not cleared (you get the drift), we decided to try Club again. Any better... ? Read on.This time was insane. Came with family and my brother and his family. Checked in Thurs 17 Dec at 3 pm. 2 Rooms on Club floor. Couldnt find anywhere to park. The Valet even refused to take our car. In the end we had to give our car to the Valet in the Shopping Centre next door - totally unrelated Valet companies I warn you.1st thing in - my kids noticed there was no toilet paper, no face towels and no bath towels. The extra bed hadnt been installed but we gave them some allowance as this usually takes some time. Gave the bellboy a nice tip to ensure that these things were settled. Took the precaution to call Housekeeping to settle toilet paper and towels. ""Yes sir, Yes sir""Went up to Club Lounge. Nothing changed. Drinks were still limited. No orange juice. Great - kids had to contend with pineapple or guava. Cookies were all flavoured with cinammon or ginger. No plain cookies for the little ones. Soft drinks in 2L bottles..... (you get the drift). As a precaution, told the Club staff about our Housekeeping needs. Please ensure. ""Yes sir, Yes sir""Left for a swim and returned at 6:30. No extra bed. No towels and no toilet paper. We were reduced to sharing 2 towels between 2 rooms and reusing pool towels. Made another phone call to Housekeeping. ""Yes sir, Yes sir - (you get the drift)""Returned about 930pm after dinner. Ah..... extra bed had been installed. Hang on.... still no toilet paper and no towels. My son had a stomach ache.....I was starting to frown deeply. Tissue box !! Oh oh ..... only 3 pieces of tissue. My frown became deeper. So it was back to sharing (thank God for family). ONE ROLL OF TOILET PAPER BETWEEN 2 CLUB ROOMS.... I called Housekeeping again. I did not lose my cool. I spoke nicely. ""Yes sir, Yes sir"". Tried another approach and also called Club Floor for the missing items. ""Yes sir, Yes sir""1045 pm. Nothing had materialised since 3pm, 3 calls to Housekeeping, 2 reports to Club Floor and a handsome tip to the bellboy. My nephew had also since then developed an urge to defecate. Our toilet paper status was getting grim.No choice. Batman wasnt going to come save us. Dad had to do the unpleasant task of introducing himself to the Night Manager. 30 minutes later - 4 rolls of toilet paper and a mound of towels. Some muttered apology and a promise to bring it up at the morning meeting. Service recovery? None. No fruit basket, no free upgrade, no voucher for our next trip..... zip. Which kinda summarises my score for this hotel. (Tripadvisor doesnt allow zero ratings).Oh and the nightmare didnt end there..... our cars took 40 minutes (enough time to drive to Seremban!) to retrieve from the reserved Valet lots when we checked out on 19 Dec. Even though the driveway in front of the hotel was devoid of cars. We almost wanted to report our vehicles missing.So..... save yourselves the angst my dear reader. Give this hotel a very wide berth. If you're not convinced by my review and do choose to stay here, do not book a room with breakfast. There is so much food within walking distance you wont regret saving yourself a few tens of dollars. We valued location over service for the very last time. Never again. Stay somewhere else and commute to Midvalley for your shopping.",Amazingly bad. Falls so short of target it hurts.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,ladysuzywoozy,"Was at the hotel over the Xmas weekend. It was a circus at practically all the public spaces in the hotel. The lobby was crowded with people checking in and out. Luggage was everwhere, and even on the floor. The concierge could not cope with the cars streaming in. My husband requested for valet parking and they told him that valet parking was full! Amazing!The Executive Lounge was filled with people who were too animated during cocktail hour. They refused to move from the lounge while other guests had to wait for seats to be free. An extended family who occupied too many seats could be heard planning to hold a birthday party in the lounge during the cocktail hour whilst other guests could not even find a place to seat. Teenagers were busy using the laptops there and could be seen not moving from their seats. With free broadband in the room, it is a real wonder to me why they refused to surf the net in the comfort of their room. The staff were not able to handle the people there. Food was lacking in quantity and there was waiting time for it to be replenished.Breakfast was another circus. The restaurant could not handle the crowd. It took the staff time to refill the food trays. They also took a long while to clear the tables. The queue outside the restaurant was long. The could have just opened up a function room or ballroom to cater to the crowd. It was indeed an eventful stay at the hotel. We sigh with relief as we checked out.",Circus Everywhere,Lingkaran Syed Putra,1,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,Singapore,2009-12-29,59200,2016-10-08 22:23
Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Perrelet,"Have stayed here on 2 previous occasions, both times were alright. However on my 3rd stay, I had to wait 6.5 hrs for the room to be ready. Could've been because of the holiday season but it was clear that the hotel was understaffed. Housekeeping was totally useless & it was clear that it was a rushed job. Towels weren't changed. Towels & bedsheets weren't properly laundered. Tea cups still had lipstick stains on them. Most annoying was the fact that they didn't understand the words DO NOT DISTURB!The scene @ the Executive Lounge had to be seen to be believed @ breakfast time. There weren't enough tables and ppl were milling around, waiting for tables. A lot of ppl walked away disgusted with the fact that they paid for breakfast but weren't able to have it.The quality of food was average at best. Quantity was of course grossly insufficient.Didn't try the restaurants in the hotel though. If what was dished out @ breakfast was any indication of the food quality, I think it's probably safe to assume that the quality of the hotel's restaurants' would be in the same ball park. On the upside, the location is excellent. Excellent choice of food from the restaurants in Mid Valley Mall & Mid Valley Gardens. Front desk staff were pretty well trained & well mannered. Staff @ the Executive Lounge were impeccably well mannered! Possibly the only saving grace of this most recent stay.","Nice hotel, pity about the staffing.",Lingkaran Syed Putra,2,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,Melbourne,2009-12-23,59200,2016-10-08 22:23
Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Sunmoon18,"Stayed there with family at executive floor over a weekend. Over the weekends, the hotel primarily serves the weekenders out on shopping spree at the 2 malls adjacent. The rooms are newish and everything works within the room. Everything as what you would expect of the hotel in this class and price range in KL. The hotel didn't strike us being particularly full or crowded, except for one area...Breakfast is a zoo at the hotel. The main restaurant couldn't cope with breakfast crowds and spilled over the executive lounge. Quality of food at lounge was very mediocre and ofcourse service levels suffered, although the staff did try. Although breakfast was packaged with the rooms, for the 4 days we were there, we didn't manage breakfast at the main restaurant once, and didn't try the lounge again aft the 1st awful experience . No one could explain why they didn't plan to open up their ballrooms to cope with breakfast crowds. This can't be the 1st time they had crowds in the hotel!If you stay here, plan to have your breakfast at Starbucks or something.",Good but....,Lingkaran Syed Putra,3,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,Singapore,2009-12-22,59200,2016-10-08 22:23
Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,keecheng,"Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in Executive Premier Room. Friendly staff and good service with nice and huge room with limited TV programmes. The executive lounge was nothing fantastic only with free flow of drinks all day and 2 hours of limited choice of snacks in the evening. Breakfast at the lounge was limited too and we prefer to go to restaurant at 6 floor with better varieties. Although the spread of food at the restaurant was better, but it was very pack during the BF period and be prepare for long queue. Good location for those who like shopping in mid valley mega mall and the garden mall. Overall this hotel is a good choice for those non smokers as smoking is confine to designated places in the hotel. For those who are driving, you can park your car at The Garden Premier Carpark (Multi storey carpark) or Zone B (Basement) and remember to redempt your car park coupon at the hotel lobby (just pay RM5 when exist) during check out.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Jules_in_Malaysia,"I had under-estimated my length of stay in KL on a recent trip and since Le Meridien refused to let me extend at the online booking price, I quickly searched and booked my husband and I into The Gardens at Mid-Valley, It was a really a great choice.The hotel was very new, the decor was nice and though the room was not very large, it was adequate for 2 persons. There were plenty of woredrobe space and the bathroom was rather lovely, especially the shower area. The rain shower had good pressure and it was really very relaxing.I like the fact that the hotel is connected to the mall and was so convenient to get food, shopping and even watch movies.I definitely will be back soon.","Great location, lovely rooms.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,PortiaLuv,"Stayed for 3D2N there. Our room overlooking the swimming pool and it's a great view. All rooms are non-smoking and I think they all probably look the same regardless of its rate. I love the gym and it is usually not occupied. The water in the pool tasted a bit salty, probably has to do with the hotel's branding towards environmental friendliness. Bathroom doesn't come with a lock, it takes me a while to get used to it. Service is good. But my husband was a bit annoyed because the staff came over to ask him to talk on the phone outside the cafeteria, saying he was talking too loud on the mobile phone. The staff was polite but then it was rude in a sense that we all understand that a hotel cafeteria is not a library.. there is not even a keep silent signage anywhere.. duhhhLocation is excellent - easy access to shopping malls in The Garden as well as Midvalley megamall and so do Cititel and Boulevard.. My husband said he would rather pay for the cheaper rate of an equivalent room in Cititel. He enjoyed his stay in Cititel during his previous visit there despite all the negative comments I have read in about it. I was the 'culprit' who convinced him to stay in the Garden this round and I think we won't be making a repeat stay. Breakfast spread in The Garden was just ok (if not below par) for the 5 star rating and my husband actually preferred Cititel's. I have to agree with him, if I were to compare the breakfast spread in other 3 or 4 star hotels I had stayed before. Unless there is an ongoing promotion on the room rate, I would probably give Cititel or Boulevard a try the next time I make a trip staying in Midvalley area. They are all in the same location anyway. Overall, for me, it was a pleasant stay.",May opt for Cititel or Boulevard in the next visit,Lingkaran Syed Putra,3,The Gardens Hotel & Residences,Msia,2009-12-03,59200,2016-10-08 22:23

Great rooms, great service and close to the Mid Valley shopping malls which are full of dining options. I will be travelling to KL in Jan with the family and have booked in to this hotel. It's about 10-15mins by taxi to KLCC area which might put a few off, but having stayed at a couple of hotels in the city (inc Novotel, which I thought was not good), I am very comfortable with the short trip in and out.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,crispypata,"I stayed at The Gardens Hotel & Residences Kuala Lumpur for 6D/5N during the second week of October 2009 during a business trip. I was told by my colleagues that the hotel is very new so I had very high expectations. Thank God it lived up to my expectations. I stayed in a very nice executive floor single room in the 25th floor which comes with free buffet breakfast either at The Spread (located in the 6th floor) or Executive Lounge located at the 29th floor. The food was extensive with local cuisine but since Malaysia is a Muslim country, dont expect any pork in the menu (good bye crispy pork bacon!). A selection of heavy snacks and drinks are for free in Club Lounge from 5:00 to 7:00 pm. My room also comes with free broadband internet but unfortunately there are times that it is very slow and you end up just sleeping. No Wi-Fi in the room. I was also given free laundry for 3 pieces everyday but just some caution, dont forget to put the sign outside your door indicating you have dirty laundry before 9 am or else you will receive your laundry the next day. I had the misfortune of doing this mistake on my second to the last day and almost left KL without 3 shirts but fortunately, the hotel was able to get them before I checked out at 8 am.Although the hotel is quite far from Bukit Bintang and KLCC, I was able to sneak some shopping in the big Midvalley Megamall and the newly opened The Gardens Mall just below the hotel. I was able to buy a nice pair of leather shoes at 70% at the Isetan Department Store inside The Gardens Mall.I am really happy with my long stay at the Gardens.

Staff was friendly and polite.Nice functional modern room.Very clean .View from room were good ( u can still see tiny petronas tower ).Swimming pool were HUGE. All in all a very good hotel , nothing much i can fault. The only slacking part is if you are paying in cash they will ask you for an exorbitant amount of deposit! The cost for a deluxe room including breakfast for walk-in was RM350. They demanded RM800 for deposit.Kinda ridiculous, the very last time we took a studio room at The MAYA for RM450 and the deposit is only RM500.Anyway, not a big deal since it is refundable during check out.Breakfast spread was very good but very crowded. The whole restaurant is pack with people.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,Helsinki1972,"We have stayed here now 2 times and are pleased with the Gardens hotel. Location: At the Gardens Mall (and connecting Midvalley Megamall), thus a great place for shopping, especially during the Malaysia Sales weeks. The Hotel is also one train stop from ""downtown"", about 50minutes to KLIA (approx 70Ringitt by Taxi) and about 25 min. from Batu Caves (approx 30Ringitt by Taxi)Room: we took the executive suite. It is only a few Euros more and you get a large room and access to the lounge (last year we stayed in a normal room and whilst it was good as well, I think it is worth the few Euros extra, especially if you stay more than one night). We paid 65Euros a night for 2pp incl. BF. The room is very spacious, large windows, very nice decoration and a huge wonderful bathroom. Check the pictures. All clean (we did got moved though, since we had 2 cochroaches in our first room, but this could happen anywhere, not the hotel to blame).Lounge: Was terrific, canapes were great, excellent. A lot of choice and high quality. I suspect they were ""leftovers"" from lunch buffet, but never mind, it was good! Also as much drinks (including cold beers) as you want. Breakfast: Very good. A lot of choice, so you better take your time! In a very modern setting. One of the better breakfasts we had. Service: Outstanding! As they did not have non lactose milk, the supervisor of the lounge organised special milk for me the next day. And the next day, it seemed like all waiters, even in the breakfast restaurant were aware of it.

Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,kewpielovesyou,"Was in KL for a wedding. Stayed at The Prince Hotel which is right across from The Pavillion Shopping centre. I was very underwhelmed by The Prince (that's another story which I will cover in a separate review). A family friend who works in PR recommended this hotel to me. I went with her to check out the hotel, and the reception staff was kind enough to show us the rooms. I was gob smacked! The rooms were nicely appointed with lots of storage space. An equally impressive bathroom - all in a standard room.I went back to The Prince hotel, cancelled my forward reservation (I was going to Vietnam for a few days and returning to KL again) and booked to stay at the Prince.When i eventually checked in, I was really pleased with the room. Everything was in working order. It also helped that things were new. You could still smell the 'drying paint', so to speak. Wooden veneer cupboards, little smart storage compartments all thru out the room. A nice arm chair too, that you could just plonk yourself on with a good book in hand and watch the hustle and bustle of KL city go by from the room.The included buffet breakfast was a highlight. Located on a floor that had a terrace, you could walk out and get some air and just admire the skyline (not much of one). The range of food was just supreme. Great service too.Shopping of cos is a must when in KL. The Gardens is located next to Mid Valley. You'd never get bored. Taxi trips to the airport can also be arranged by reception.

The room was nice too, with a large modern layout & bathroom, flat screen tv etc. But with <10 tv channels, they can do more. The free internet was a plus. The pool was nice, but small, and so was the poolside menu. It's not like those giant resort and spa 5 star pools. The gym however, was very large, 1 of the most spacious I've seen. The breakfast spread was good, though I think the fruit juice glasses were oddly miniscule. It was as if they don't want you to drink that much juice. I think the hotel like Boulevard and Citadel next door was built just to accomodate shoppers for the Mega Mall and Gardens Mall next door, so it's really convenient if you came to KL just to shop.
