Kuala Lumpur,Cititel Mid Valley Lingkaran Syed Putra,Cititel Mid Valley,Malaysia,"Stayed 4 nites in August 2016 :Three Complaints : 1. Shower Cubicle water leaking into Toilet floor : Water seeps up from beneath the floor tiles and flood the entire toilet floor after each shower. This shows that House Keeping did not check + wash the Shower area, as they would have seen the leaks if they had washed the shower daily. 2. Misleading Car Parking Info given by Front Desk : 1st Staff told me there is ONLY ONE Complimentary car bay allocated for hotel guests and it is always taken, hence i parked at the Mall and paid RM5 per entry basis to avoid wasting time hoping for that One Bay. 2nd Staff told me we can park in any of the many Complimentary bays within the hotel parking section 3rd Staff told me to just insert my Parking Ticket into the Exit Arm Reader without informing me that i have to first Validate my ticket into the Auto Park Machine hidden away at the Basement Lift Lobby Corner, resulting in me stucked at the Exit Reader. Can you please have a consistent SOP on Parking to stop all confusions to your Guests, you can put all these Info on a Note for Guests Parking inside the Rooms and also pass one to the Guests upon their Enquiries on Parking at the Front Desk. 3. Hotel Feedback via Email : There is a Note in the Room requesting for Guests Feedback via Email. Upon checkout, nobody requested for my Email to send the Feedback Form to me. This speaks volume on your Hotel S.O.PAs there is no Feedback Form given upon checkout, this is the only way to inform you.",2016/10/08 13:00:14,2016-10-06,Toilet Leaking ...

If you want to shop in Mid Valley and (or) The Gardens area, this hotel is the best way to save your shopping money. The room is so small for its class. Be careful to stay here if you are fat, the shower room maybe is not enough for you since it is really really small.

Room is ok and staff are warm and courteous.Forgot to inform the hotel about the faulty safe in the room (2707) when checking out. It showed ""Error"" when we tried to lock the safe. The time in the lifts gave us a few scare but guess no one really check the time in the lifts anyway.The hotel used to include steamed mini rice noodle roll in the breakfast spread. According to the staff at the egg counter, the hotel no longer serve that for breakfast.
