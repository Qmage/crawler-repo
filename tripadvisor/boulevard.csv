59200,jicby2,2016-10-04,"I've stayed numerous times at their sister (and much cheaper) hotel, Cititel Mid Valley however for the higher price I paid at Boulevard, I was expecting a much nicer room. The carpets throughout the hotel was very old and stained. The carpet in my room wasn't that much better and was all crinkly. The general amenities and cleanliness of the hotel was fine and the location on top of a large shopping mall was very convenient. It is such a shame it is let down by the overall tired feeling - for a hotel that looks fairly busy you'd think they'd understand the value of a refresh every 5 years or so to keep the place looking in tiptop condition.I'd rather much save the extra money and stay at Cititel, at least then I could justify the price for staying in an older decor. Their customer service was very good so can't fault them on that.",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,"Sydney, New South Wales, Australia",Malaysia,Great location but dated looking decor,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:15:25,3,Mid Valley Expressway
59200,Frenchbd,2016-10-01,"The hotel is an old 1980s Fit-out in desperate need of an update. The beds are hard, the furniture is old and very dated and the carpet is worn, faded, has iron burn marks on it and is very tired. The hotel car transfer I organized apparently broke down and they couldn't find a replacement. I ended up getting a taxi however they still tried to charge me and I was told I didn't show up! Then on departure the reception organized a car for 4am rather than 4pm. I was woken at 4am asking me why I hadn't checked out. Finally when I went to catch the car at 4pm I was greeted by a taxi, not a hire car!! I don't know why I paid extra for a cab that I could have simply got off the street. The entire experience was very disappointing.",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,"Sydney, Australia",Malaysia,Old and tired.

59200,PubuduA,2016-09-26,I stayed at this hotel when I came to KL for an IT training.Stayed at this hotel for 6 days.Overall this is a very nice hotel with friendly staff who looked in to guest needs well.Rooms were nice and spacious and I should give special recognition to house keeping team as they did a great job in room cleaning and service.I stayed with BB and breakfast were tasty and good in quality but unfortunately variation of food was very little and needs improvement.This hotel has a nice little pool and you can enjoy and relax.One thing I was disappointed was in-room WIFI which was not working from the day one.No signals at all and I informed to hotel staff but one guy came and checked and saidentire floor area(17th floor) seems to having an signal drop and will inform relevant division.But disappointing to say that it never got fixed :(.So management needs to check on this issue as it was a very trouble to me during the stay.This hotel is situated very near to the midvalley shopping mall and other shopping/business areas and train/bus services are also near.It will take around 45 mins drive to KL international airport.Overall I happy with my stay at this hotel.,The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,"Negombo, Sri Lanka",Malaysia,Nice stay in KL,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:15:25,4,Mid Valley Expressway
59200,Alan T,2016-09-18,"I've been to boulevard several times in the last decade so we decided to stay there again when we went to visit. We ordered one of the executive suites as we were travelling with a child and needed another bed. The evecutive lounge (no children under 12) was nice and my wife enjoyed a nice breakfast while 3 year old and I had breakfast in the wild rice restaurant. The size of the room was good and easily fit another small single bed which is what we wanted. Also the fact it was so convenient to the mall was a huge bonus. The room was starting to become a bit tired tho, with large brown marks on the blue carpet in some spaces so its definitely due for renovations and the curtains had dark stains as well. Otherwise the facilities like the gym were relatively well maintained.",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,,Malaysia,Nice but a bit old,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:15:25,3,Mid Valley Expressway

59200,crawfie,2016-09-11,"The Boulevard is a large business type hotel, adjoining the Mega Mall of KL. The reception area is very bright and marble, but the rooms are clean but no frills. Bottled water and free internet are provided. The beds are comfortable, but the rooms are poor for sound deadening. There is a good Gym and the pool is of a good size. Breakfasts are typical of far East hotels, with Western and local choices. Maintenance is suspect, and my first room had a flood through the ceiling on day 2. Getting a replacement room was difficult due to the intransigence of the staff, who were less than typical of most of my far East experience. I was first offered a twin room, and then an upgrade to the 28th floor, at a cost. I pointed out the problem was of the hotels making, and they eventually relented on the cost! The upgraded room was identical to the previous one, but had a chocolate bar and a couple of fruit drinks. It did allow access to the executive lounge which was very good, with complimentary snacks / drinks in the early evening. There is a railway station nearby for KL, but the service is at best 2 an hour.

59200,Devi1ishUk,2016-08-11,"Where do I begin? For starters, my request for 2 non-smoking rooms was not met. I was subsequently ""upgraded"" to a deluxe room on a smoking floor. I was also assured that the room would be refreshed before hand. The room reeked of stale smoke despite being ""refreshed"" (which consisted of someone giving a few cursory sprays of air freshener). Upon unlocking the door, I could hardly open the room door as the carpet in the room was so badly creased, it blocked the door from opening properly. On top of this, the carpet was horribly stained through out. Things soon went from bad to worse when I decided to have a shower and found that despite cranking the hot water all the way up, all I got was a slightly better than ice cold flow. Lastly, the shower fittings were damaged where they emerged from the tiled wall. As I was staying there for two nights, I had requested a change of room for the second nights stay and was assured that a non-smoking room had been reserved. Needless to say, when I went to change the room the following day, I was told that the rooms were no longer available. Having conveyed this and more to the check-out lady, I was assured that I would be hearing from the hotel management.

As we were staying two nights, we asked to be moved to non-smoking rooms on the second night and had been told they would be reserved. And despite this, they still failed to secure non-smoking rooms for us and gave it to others. Such incompetence. They offered to refresh the room which amounts to spraying some febreeze into the air which does next to nothing when smoke has permeated every furnishing, cloth, airway, and the entire corridor outside. The offered to upgrade us to premium rooms in the smoking section.

The hotel itself is in a beautiful location set in the middle of Bangsar, and on top of a mega mall. It is also adjacent to the Garden Mall - everything of which is accessible without the need of going out of the premises.The proximity of all the shops, restaurants is just a shoppers dream!The service was ok. I can't rate it 5* because of some complications at the reservations desk - the staff seemed unsure or confused about what to do with us, a family of 6 including 2 children. They wanted to upgrade 1 room and downgrade another which we though unfair since we paid a decent amount for each room per night, After much haggling and waiting, we finally got a room - nearly 2 hours after check in, and considering we were late on arrival in the first place - it should not have been the case.As for departure, they were not even considerate enough to allow us extra time of 2 hours (due to the disservice on check in, and the delay) as our flight was in the evening.The room service and laundry services were quite good. Efficient, and quick.The breakfast dining area located on the 9th floor, was ok. Nothing to write home about - in fact the selection at our previous Hotel, was much better. However - it wasn't bad or anything. I guess we were impressed with a larger selection at our previous location, and for which we paid much less, than the somewhat minimalistic selection at The Boulevard.The room was tastefully decorated, and the bathroom/shower area was pleasant! The Wi-Fi wasn't all that great.I would probably opt to stay at St Giles The Gardens next time, and because of the fact that our family loves the mall, cafe and restaurant scenery, The Boulevard could be our second choice.

When I arrived to HK the clothes I had taken with me smelt of cigarettes from the room- it festers and it's particularly pleasant. The room is a large size, the bed also, no complaints there. Bathroom was great. The carpets were not nice, I wouldn't have walked bare foot, they were somewhat sticky. Using the hotel for business after my seminar I wanted to relax by swimming but despite the hotel having a smaller childrens pool next to the big one groups of families insisted on using the main pool so their children could mess around making swimming impossible. They were also shrieking and screaming and generally being badly behaved. No one watches the pool so no staff intervention. The kids were diving but the pool is very shallow, never above my waist and I am 5'9 so an accident waiting to happen. Breakfast seems ok- coffee is pretty bad though. A mix of chinese, malay and western breakfast. Lots of cheese but no ham, bacon etc. Nice selection of bread. From the hotel lobby you can walk straight into the mall and only a 5 minute walk to the KL Kummuter line, easy access to KL Sentral. Good taxi links too. Great shopping and food options in the mall.

59200,youarehere,2016-06-13,"The booking at Boulevard started well. Quite soon after I made the booking I got a call from the hotel, clarifying details about my booking. However, during the check-in itself, things went downhill. We were there at around 230pm on a Saturday and was told our rooms were not available. I hadn't realised at that time that check-in was 2pm and thought it was 3. We were told our rooms had been set aside for us but would only be ready at 315. We went off for a late lunch and got back after 330pm and were told that one of the rooms booked was still not ready. The receptionist then spent a good 15 minutes scrambling around trying to find a room. She finally found one, which makes me wonder why that room wasn't immediately available to us when we went to reception. It also raises the question of what happened to one of the rooms that had supposedly been set aside for us and suddenly disappeared in the interim. You either have a room or you don't - it shouldn't disappear into a black hole in less than an hour. Another example of the hotel's inefficiency was wifi. In both rooms, the assigned wifi user name and password didn't work. Instead, we had to use the general user name and password, which sometimes kicked us out because too many users were on it. The room itself was adequate. The beds were firm enough although the bathroom did sometimes smell. We thought it had something to do with the sewage system rather than the actual cleanliness of the bathroom. Housekeeping did a good job of cleaning the room. The hotel is good if you want to go shopping at Mid Valley Mega mall. Foodwise: Walk through the main entrance of the hotel, turn left and there's a bunch of good eating places - antipodean coffee is a really good breakfast venue. In all, Boulevard would have been a good choice for a Mid Valley stay if not for the annoying experience at reception.

The first time, I was surrounded by noisy neighbours and given the limited sound insulation that was a serious nuisance. The second time, I was given a room on the top floor, but it turned out to be a connecting room and I had to endure the noise from the party the youngsters were having in the connected room well into the night. Besides, the furniture and carpet in the room were cheap and worn out. On the positive side, breakfast was just OK, and wifi was alright. Also, the proximity of the shopping mall and Kmuter is a plus.

59200,NWellman,2016-06-02,"Stayed many times on business, always in the executive rooms which give access to the exec lounge with its free refreshments and food (tiger beer, Black label scotch. The ""canapes"" include various rice/noodle dishes, prawns, kebabs etc, plus sticky cakes, so, if on a budget you can save on food and bar bills. Breakfast can be Exec Lounge or main restaurant: despite less choice, I personally preferred the lounge.Rooms have gradually been upgraded over the 4 years I visited. Staff very friendly and as I visited c13 times over 4 years, they get to recognise and know you :-)However, pity to have lost the fishpond area to make more restaurant space and the afternoon tea, which used to be tiers of cakes and sandwiches is much reduced. Food is OK but in KL you're generally better eating out (if you're brave enough, where the locals eat). Locally I can recommend the Chinese and Japanese places and for German beer and food Brotzeit, all just a few minutes along the main mall from the hotel and, towards the bottom end, Aunty Nat's (up two flights of stairs opposite the Library bar).Very convenient for shopping in the mall and trains to KL from just down from the hotel. If using taxi it's cheaper to use the local cabs rather than the blue ones from outside the doorway, but beware being ripped of RM11-15 should be enough to get into KL: getting back is more likely to be a rip off (tho' there's an app to send photo of cab to the authorities if they try it on)Colleagues used the pool and gym, both of which they say were good.I suspect few manage it, but a trip down through the car park to visit the Indian Temple just on the edge of the Mall is well worthwhile.",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,"Bristol, United Kingdom",Malaysia,13 enjoyable stays with friendly staff,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:15:34,4,Mid Valley Expressway

For some reason, I was under the impression that this hotel was a more upscale version of Gardens Hotel (next door). We stayed there during our previous business trip and thought to try out Boulevard this time. It was only after I checked in then I realised that I was wrong. Boulevard hotel is more of a business hotel with the basic requirements needed for business travellers. Breakfast selection was ok, but the food did not look nor taste appetizing. However, some of the room service dishes were not bad (char kway tiao). WiFi was very slow, and cuts off frequently. I gave up trying to Facetime with my parents after the first day. TV channels are also limited and the channels are not very clear (poor reception?). In addition, part of the hotel faces the roads and it was very noisy, despite being on the 20th floor.

59200,Meg E,2016-02-02,I just checked into this hotel and could not believe when I read One of the numerous signs posted at the front desk that any on return key cards would be charged 10 RMB!! I think the best part is when the actually asked for a deposit before we even got the key card. The fact that I absolutely cannot believe that they charge because in my entire 33 year career as a hotelier I have never come across anything like this. I booked my rooms on looking to come back in December and there was no indication of this. My rooms were already prepaid so what happened if I had no cash for the deposit? What I'd never be able to get into my room?Knowing firsthand with the key cards cost it makes me wonder if the guests are paying for the supply and what's next what we pay for shampoo? I would expected the key card to at least put in the price of the room.,The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,"Bangkok, Thailand",Malaysia,They charge for key cards!!,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:15:43,3,Mid Valley Expressway

Rooms were clean. Nice small pools. Breakfast buffet was normal.Some minor gripes were the parking was not free - Rm5 for overnight parking (need to get the ticket stamped at the hotel before getting the discount), had to jostle with the shoppers over the parking lots.Hotel is away from the main shopping belt but Midvalley is sufficient for our shopping needs. There are other hotels link to Midvalley but we are quite comfortable with this hotel.

59200,Nikhil Rohan R,2016-01-16,"I stayed at St. Giles Bouevard for almost a week, and found it to be a comfortable hotel. Its location in Mid Valley gives you a great access to other parts of Kuala Lumpur, although it takes over an hour from the airport.The hotel is convenient for both, business and pleasure, due to its close location to the business establishments, shopping mall and some really good restaurants.The service was alright, but couldve been better. I used concierge to call taxi a couple of times, and they were helpful. Hotel also has free laundry service depending on your plan.Breakfast was not bad, but it wasnt anything too fancy. The breakfast was self-service, and it was bit crowded. The check-in and check-out were no pain, and front desk staff were friendly, although it was a bit difficult to communicate in English over the phone at times. Lobby is spacious, but somewhat plainly decorated.The room was comfortable, clean and quite, with good facilities such as a safe, a refrigerator, a TV and so on. Bathroom had a shower but no bath tub; bathroom had all the standard amenities such as shower gel.

The staff in the executive lounge are fantastic and try and meet all your needs and make you feel very welcome.Our room had a constant leak form the Aircon and all they did was send a guy with a bucket each time. Subsequently at night the aircon would shut off. The staff at the front desk grasp of English when you wanted something disappeared and they consistently tried to not help us. The service in wild rice and flutes was terrible the staff are more interested in watching TV or either cannot understand English. Even when we left the bell boy and concierge thought it was funny we where going to a 5 star hotel for Christmas and made comment in malay to his friends, this made it very uncomfortable and again we received hardly any help leaving.

59200,tommomelbourne,2016-01-06,We had a one night stay at this hotel after a late flight from Manila. We thought it was a great opportunity to visit the Mid Valley Mega Mall. This hotel is attached to this Mall and the Gardens Mall.This hotel had a lovely lobby but unfortunately the rooms are quite dated with a horrible and unmatching colour scheme. We requested and received a high floor and had great views poolside from our room. The hotel offers a 24hr restaurant called Wild Rice where I had a lovely late meal. Outside the hotel are several restaurants/bars that do open up quite late.The hotel has a lovely large pool area which is accessed from the restaurant level.If I was in the area again I would probably try another hotel......perhaps their sister hotel St Giles The Gardens but it is more expensive.,The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,"Melbourne, Australia",Malaysia,Location is this hotel's biggest asset,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:15:46,3,Mid Valley Expressway
59200,sarahhobart,2016-01-05,"I always like to stay at least 2 nights at the Mid Valley Megamall whenever I holiday in Malaysia. Its a great mall with good shopping, good food, money changers, cinema etc, and the best thing about the St Giles Boulevard is that it's located right next to the mall. Walk through the linkway and you're there. The Cititel standards are too low and the Gardens too expensive, which makes the Boulevard the best option for me.My mother, brother and I stayed in 2 rooms at the end of our stay. We had to book two rooms because they don't offer rooms with a third or extra bed. They gave us adjoining rooms with a shared door between which was highly convenient.We drove during this trip, and found the valet parking at the hotel very reasonable (RM20 for 24 hours for hotel guests), and in my mind safer than parking overnight in the mall carpark. The valet was quite unfriendly though, but the guy that opened the doors for us was very friendly and helpful.The best reception service I received on this trip (we stayed at 3 different hotels) was from Shazwan ( I think that's how its spelled) at the Boulevard. He was warm, friendly, obliging and efficient with excellent English skills. Check-in was a pleasure. Since we arrived at 2pm only 1 room was ready, which was not a problem. We just put all the bags in there first. The valet was prompt and friendly, and a bit surprised when I tipped him. I asked Shazwan for one Twin and 1 King, adjoining, non-smoking, no problem. I asked for late check out on one room because I had a late night flight to catch, and since I had booked 2 rooms and only requested one late checkout, Shazwan was kind enough to allow a 4pm checkout without charge. He said our other room keys would be brought up to us when the room was ready, and brought them up himself with apologies and a warm smile. Congratulations to St Giles Boulevard for excellent staff training, a job well done.The rooms themselves were comfortable, well equipped, and most important of all, clean. The carpets did not look threadbare, and not a skerrick of mould anywhere in the bathroom. Despite not being a new hotel, it did not look shabby at all, well done maintenance. The King room had a bolster, which was a plus as I miss mine in hotels.I had only 3 issues, all in the Twin room. Firstly there were two iron burns on the carpet right in the middle of the room in front of the adjoining door. They were large enough for me to make out the shape and size of the iron. Not good to look at and not good to walk on. Carpet should have been repaired or patched. Secondly, the laundry line in the shower (great thing to have) had a broken head, the plastic bit that hooks in to the other side had broken off. No use providing a laundry line if housekeeping doesn't check that it is usable. Thirdly, the sink tap was one of those with a metal pin to pivot up or down for water flow. It fell off in my hand during the first use and from the looks of it the thread had worn off some time ago and housekeeping was just putting it in the hole to look good. This was confirmed when I lay it on the toiletries tray for housekeeping to see the next day but they just left it there despite re-filling the tray. Housekeeping should be the ones informing maintenance about this sort of thing. Beside hotel guests they are the people that see and are in the rooms and know the condition that things are in. Poorly done there.Overall, as usual, I was pleased with my stay at the Boulevard and will be back again next time I'm in KL.",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,"Hobart, Australia",Malaysia,"Good hotel, gret location",Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:15:46,4,Mid Valley Expressway

59200,MsChipper,2015-12-31,"Staying here for the 4th time this year, and it's my last visit to KL in 2015. Rooms are OK, due to our early check in, I was given one with twin beds even though I was a single occupancy. Wifi is still limited to 2 devices and you still need a username and password to log in. It would be better if they increased it to 3 devices since most travelers now have more than 2 devices on them at any given time. It's rather inconvenient to keep logging out and in when you have to switch devices.Room service staff are friendly and helpful, but don't expect a lot in the amenities provided. Breakfast-wise, usually I find the food to be lacking in variety and the taste is just average. Personally, the only thing I enjoy are the fruits and the occasional fried noodles.For a business traveler, this hotel is good enough, but if you're here for a holiday and you're looking for something a bit more luxurious and you're willing to splurge, then maybe Gardens Hotel might be a better option.",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,Singapore,Malaysia,Some upgrading would be good,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:15:47,3,Mid Valley Expressway

59200,GraceLim,2015-09-03,"We have been at this hotel long time ago and we recently we were back again !I would like to take the opportunity to specially THANK Mr Aaron Tan for his professionalism and attention. He has displayed the zest to listen to customers' suggestions and improve further the hotel's service ! He is a gem to the hotel because he is concern and ready to enhance the guests' stay in the hotel.However, the hotel might need a 'face lift' in terms of the carpet, wooden furniture and especially the air-conditioning. However, the hotel has really helped when they offered me a standing fan during my stay.The staff are also polite and hardworking especially in the Wild Rice Restaurant, Mr Walid. During our few days stay, we have observed that Mr Walid has not only served the guests tea and coffee, bring the guests to their seats, note the room numbers etc etc. He has been working non stop during the breakfast hours but he maintains a hearty smile all the time ! Well Done !The house keeping on the 23rd Floor, Ms Rumiati - has been so kind and helpful too. She has kept our room clean and neat all the time..thank you for making our stay such a pleasant one.The downside of this hotel - the parking. If we are to park ourselves, it costs only rm5 per entry but if we do valet, they charge daily rm 20 per 24 hours. It is not easy to find the correct parking that will easily lead us to the hotel and since it is a mega mall, parking is not easy. If only the hotel could offer free valet parking services, that would be good !Nonetheless, the hotel is worth a visit.......",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,"Singapore, Singapore",Malaysia,Convenient Hotel Location,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:15:54,4,Mid Valley Expressway

The hotel is nicely placed for shops and restaurants ate nearby and found some nice bars etc. I also ate in the Hotel and the food was very nice, there wasn't many people in the restaurant however.Room was starting to get a little tired and maybe it's time to re vamp before it gets any worse. My fridge for example didn't work, and a few decoration problems, nothing major.However the service in the hotel, including the laundry service was excellent, staff very polite checkin, and checkout wasn't a hassle.

59200,ColBeard,2015-08-19,"My experience at the Boulevard was really good for the third year running. The swimming pool is absolutely fabulous and there is a small area for children too. The gymnasium is very well equipped and spacious and it overlooks the swimming pool. Breakfast is as you would expect: a cosmopolitan affair with everything you could wish for. The food is well presented and nicely cooked. Outside there are seats right next to a long thin pool full of small carp and other goldfish. Sat next to this area you only have to glance at the fish and you feel extremely relaxed sat having a coffee and breakfast and reading the paper, away from more the hustle bustle of the many people in the dining room. The room I stayed in was lovely and spotlessly clean. It was spacious, bright and comfortable. I slept well in the giant bed and was the bedding was a little tired some people say on reviews and maybe the decor a little bit plain, but for me these were not a problem. The staff are friendly and helpful. There is a pleasant mood in this hotel. The hotel is surrounded by and indeed connected directly to shopping malls. This is convenient in terms of buying anything or just browsing or going for a coffee somewhere. There are plenty of places to eat in the Mall and to meet people. I had a couple of business meetings in the mall and it was very pleasant. My only difficulty as a business traveller was that the Boulevard Internet was unsatisfactory for the first day: but when speaking to a technical expert it appears there are two Wi-Fi options and one of them is titled SBLV which on the second day gave me exceptional reception. It was just so frustrating that I had already spent wasted time trying to contact people, access my emails, Skype and generally conduct my business. Front of desk staff do need to be informed so that any complaints can be dealt with instead of the simple 'I will reconnect you sire please try again in 2 minutes!

59200,alkalinesoap,2015-08-10,"there are three hotels here and i choose the boulevard as it is priced in the middle. i had a late check in as my flight got delayed due to weather. reaching the hotel at 830pm, i was then told that only one of my rooms was ready and i had to wait for an hour for the other, alternatively, they could give me another room immediately but it was on another floor. fair enough, we decided to go for dinner first and get the room later. we went up to the room to place our bags. the room was standard, flat tv, ambient lights, iron and ironing board, digital bathroom scale. i discovered that the hotel room was incomplete : no bath towels, no bath mat, no liquid soap but two bottles of conditioning shampoo. surely the missing items issue was easily rectified - a phone call to the reception found me explaining what a bath mat was - essentially a towel that is made to be put on the floor to keep the rest of the toilet floor dry. not more than 5 minutes later (it was very fast really), a knock came and two towels were delivered. so i had to place a second call to ask for a bath mat and soap. this time i called housekeeping direct - the staff on the line just confirmed that i would like a bath mat and before i could say i wanted liquid soap too, the said thankyougoodbye. i did not bother calling a third time. we went out for dinner and when we returned and picked up the key to the other room, it was done up completely, with nothing missing. sleep was undisturbed for me but the people in the other room was disturbed by things that go bump in the night. cant help it on that front can we? anyways the beds were comfortable, the aircon was in good working condition and i liked how there were two shower head options, one hand held and one directly above your head so it can simulate rain. i also tried the gym, it was more than adequate: free weights, machines, exercise mat, treadmill and cycles and even a punching bag. one thing i liked about the hotel was that it felt like an extra security feature that the lift can only be activated if you slot in your card at the lift console in the lift and press for your floor. you are unable to access the other floors with your card except for the common facilities floors. too bad the receptionist did not tell me and i spent 5 minutes in a stationary lift trying to figure why it was not moving.

I had requested for a high floor and I was given a very nice and comfortable room on the 19th floor. Only problem was that on the day I was checking out, June 8 Monday, the fire alarm went off. It also so happens that i had just walked to the lift lobby and then when the lift lobby doors suddenly closed, I was trapped me in the lift lobby. The only alternative I had was to take the stairs down but I had my 23 kg luggage with me so I just had to wait for something like 20 minutes before everything came back on. Fortunately, check out was easy and the staff apologised profusely and wished me well. I managed to leave on time to have lunch and make my flight back.However, on the plus side and without more adventure, my stay was peaceful otherwise. I was afraid to see boisterous school kids and worried parents running around but thankfully nothing like that happened. Room service was decent.

Seeing little choice at the time because I needed to retrieve something from my luggage, I agreed.

59200,JeanWN,2015-03-04,"The Boulevard-St Giles is one of three hotels connected to the Mid-Valley Mega Mall on the verge of Kuala Lumpur, between the capital and Petaling Jaya, its sprawling satellite town. One problem with the roads in and around KL is that they seem to be the brain child of some crazed urban architect, emphasis on the ""crazed"". They seldom make sense and signage is, hmm haphazard. One wrong turn and you're lost lost lost.So, if you successfully navigate yourself to the Mid valley Mega Mall, park and stay put. The Boulevard Hotel is midway between hugely expensive and incredibly cheap. Clean, and they do have some good deals on their rooms.....at times. As always you need to shop around for great deals.The huge plus about this hotel is its connectivity to the MVM Mall. It has a side door that leads to the North Court where one could have great Penang food or just a cuppa tea at Toast Box; as well as a taxi stand right there where you could cab it to KL leaving your car and being safe from getting lost.I wouldn't call the hotel a 5 star and it is definitely not a resort hotel. Its claim to fame is that it is so close to all things on a shoppers want list. One could shop at Robinson's or get groceries from the supermarket in the nearby basement. Rates sometimes includes breakfast but fret not if you get a good deal sans breakfast, there is so much to choose from in the mall. One could go ""nuts"" trying to decide what to have for breakfast lunch or dinner.I have never taken a dip in their pool, who wants to swim when one could shop till one drops or till closing time (which ever comes first) or just nip back to your room for a power nap if needed.I vacillate between this hotel and The Gardens Hotel, which ever has the better offer for the time I want to visit KL. Oh, if you buy stuff to a certain value, in the Gardens Mall, you can get a Gardens Membership card which entitles you to use an outlandish toilet. Not just nice and clean but REALLY nice and clean!If you are a tourist, their website www.midvalley.com has a link to how you could apply for a TOURIST PRIVILEGE MVM MALL CARD, which is supposed to get you all sorts of discounts.The card it valid for a week, which will give one more than enough time to clean out the shops.

After a long drive (travelling inter state in malaysia), probably didn't wanna be checked into the wrong type of room.The hotel lobby was nice, we had a car with us, parking the car was extremely inconvenient. The car park doesn't have any direct access to the hotel lobby.

59200,Tim G,2014-10-25,"Length of stay: 9 nights, business tripRoom: Got a superior room. First impression of the room was good. The room is big, and the high ceiling made it look even more spacious. The facilities were clean and in good working condition. The usual stuff were available: toiletries including shower gel and shampoo, clean towels, hairdryer in good condition. There was an iron and ironing board as well. Using the toothbrush provided felt like rubbing a stone against my teeth. Bought a toothbrush instead. No complaints though, it simply isn't a good idea to use those provided by hotels in the first place.The only downside was the constant mechanical sound that could be heard throughout the day and even at night. Not sure where it came from, might be some valve. Constant rhythm and frequency, but I managed to sleep through it. Breakfast: Good variety and I managed to eat here every morning. Nothing to boast about. The taste was satisfactory nevertheless.Location: With direct covered access to two shopping malls housing almost 500 shops, it is very convenient. The concierge will gladly help you book a taxi if you wish to venture out of the area.Laundry: Laundry service was fast. Articles came back clean and neatly pressed/folded. Definitely trust their service.Wi-Fi: Stable connection and the speed was OK.Front desk: Efficient and friendly. I had issues when checking in but it was quickly resolved. Checkout was very quick.Other facilities: Gym and swimming pool.",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,"Singapore, Singapore",Malaysia,"Reasonably priced, clean and convenient",Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:16:13,5,Mid Valley Expressway

Good shopping in both malls, from designer shops to more medium priced shops. The hotel room was a good size, clean and good shower (once I worked it out - for the main shower you have to pull the lever towards you BEFORE switching on water), no bath but roomy bathroom for all toiletries etc. Bed king size and very comfy night too soft, pillows a bit too plump for me!

59200,Colin L,2014-09-30,"Nestled amist the Mid Valley Mega Mall, are three hotels; The Cititel, The Gardens Hotel and The Boulevard. Checked into the Boulevard and was served by a very pleasant young gentlemen. I am very biased here as he gave me an upgrade to a suite.The room was very nicely appointed with a big desk as a work area, a L shaped sofa in the spacious living area, a queen size (very firm and comfortable) and a very generous bathroom with a bath, rain shower and twin sinks.Being right smack in the middle of one of the largest mall in Kuala Lumpur, my key concern was the potential mass of people with the associated high noise level. This concern was totally unfounded. The lobby, although busy with people was always looked clean and organized and even with the occasional rain shower, one need not get wet as there is an internal passage which connects directly to the mall.Needless to say, with the close proximity of the mall, food options was not an issue. From fine dining to food courts and fast food, the choice was endless.Breakfast in Wild Rice, was nice enough. Located on the 9th floor, seating was not an issue even with the hotel at near maximum occupancy.Did not have the opportunity to enjoy the other facilities at the hotel but if the parts that I had the opportunity to patronize, I doubt that I would be disappointed,One negative note was the reliability of the free wi-fi connections. Connection kept dropping. Then again, this seems to be a common problem with most hotels that I stay in this city.Given the opportunity, I would definitely go back there again,",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,"Singapore, Singapore",Malaysia,Great Location and a very decent hotel indeed,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:16:15,4,Mid Valley Expressway

59200,PaddingtonTokyo,2014-09-21,"The hotel is adjacent to the Mid valley Mega Mall and KTM Commuter train station which is just one stop from KL Sentral (Where KL Ekspres Airport train leaves). As the train system is good, it is also good place for staying just one night for transit as I did. The shopping mall has lots of dining options. However, the hotel does not seem take an advantage of its excellent location. Although you can see the hotel from the train station which is situated above the shopping mall, you will have difficulty in finding the right entrance (elevator) to go to the lobby, because the signs are not sufficient. Once you go up to the ground floor, you have to go out of the mall and then go into the lobby. The room is quite wide and comfortable. (Some rooms do not have bathtub though). The big shortcoming is, as many reviewers have also said, that Wifi is so expensive (compared with other hotels in KL and Singapore). Even though the room rate is reasonable, and the location is excellent, the cost of wifi would definitely discourage business travelers to choose this hotel.",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,"Machida, Japan",Malaysia,Excellent location but need improvements to be competitive.,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:16:16,3,Mid Valley Expressway

They are clean, rather silent, the storage capacity is ample. If you have an executive room you are entitled to breakfast on the executive level which is quite spacious and nice.Another good thing is the big pool where you can actually swim (I estimate a 20 meters length) and also a spacious gym with all the necessary equipment including towels and mineral water.All this at a cost that seems quite reasonable given the location.",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,Paris,Malaysia,Nothing fancy but excellent location and good value for money,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:16:17,4,Mid Valley Expressway

But when we entered the room, it was 2 single beds. I called the reception, only to be told that they did not have king size available. N told us to get an extra bed with extra cost. We got fed up and took it. The room was not clean and there were stains on the carpet. There was dust on the lights and tv. The bathroom had yellow stains at the shower area. Upon check out, our bill showed extra charge for booking thru travel agent. I informed them that I booked directly thru the hotel website. At the bottom of my booking, in fine print stated that I booked thru Directwithhotel.ltd. I was shocked as I am very very confident that I booked directly. Anyway, later I found out that when you go directly to the hotel website, it's actually exactly identical to the Directwithhotel.ltd website.So, be very careful when you book.

59200,Greg N,2014-07-20,"Positives: The best part about Boulevard was its location--it is within steps of two large shopping malls, restaurants, and the commuter train. The hotel staff were nice, there is free wifi, my bathroom was nice, and the view of the city from my room was great. Negatives: But my room, despite being a suite, was nothing to write home about. The carpet had stains all over it, i kept finding ants crawling on me, and worst of all the air conditioning hardly worked and there was no fan-- and because of the heat and humidity I had a lot of trouble sleeping. Thank goodness for cold showers. I turned to the TV to keep me occupied while i was tossing and turning while trying to sleep, but it only gets 14 channels..most are news channels, and there was like one ""entertainment"" channel which played bad US movies. So be sure to bring a book or something to read. Also, a drawer in the closet was broken, so i had to fix it by finding the screw that was preventing it from closing and pushing it through the cheap wood (cardboard would have been stronger). Breakfast had very few choices--all of which made me sick--and there was no minibar in the room. Instead, there was a tiny fridge in which they invited guests to go to the grocery store and stock it with water they wanted. I actually went to a store to buy some water and soda for the fridge, but when i tried to put them in the fridge i realized that it was too small to even stand them up. There was enough room to put three bottles on their side (im not talking about two liter bottles here.. Just those regular individual size water and soda bottles). And like everything else in this country, the fridge was relatively warm and kept the beverages just below room temperature. So would I stay here again? Not unless they make some changes. It did not live up to its status of a four star hotel.

59200,Simply1005,2014-07-08,"I stayed in Cititel previously so I can't help but to compare both of them.Check-in: Check-in was smooth. The guy who checked us in allocated us rooms near to the lift. Not sure if it was because he saw my aunt with walking stick but we appreciated it a lot.Location: Boulevard is linked to Mid Valley just like Cititel. But it is so much faster to get to Boulevard than Cititel from the expressway. I was prepared for the jam and circle around mid valley before reaching the hotel and was pleasantly surprised when there's none. There is a slight detour on the way out but not as bad as Cititel.Room: The Boulevard rooms are much bigger than Cititel although the rates are comparable. Cititel's rooms have ceiling fan option while there's no such option at Boulevard. But, Boulevard's rooms may need improvement as follows1) Room 1219's aircon doesn't seem to be working. We had connecting rooms and set same air-con setting but Room 1220 was much colder than Room 1219. My aunt said she had insects bites from the bed in Room 1219 but I thought it could be because the air con wasn't cool enough.2) The shower glass door didn't seem to close properly. As a result, the floor mat was soaked.3) WIFI signal is very weak near the club chair but stronger near the desk/TV areaBreakfast: Spread is quite comparable. We liked the croissants at Boulevard but preferred the steamed chee cheong fun at Cititel to the steam dimsum (soon kueh, siew mah) at Boulevard. Think they're over steamed. Staff knowledge varied. My sister ask for easy over at the egg counter at Boulevard. The guy at the egg counter understand the order whereas the lady staff at the egg counter told my sister to take the over well egg at the counter. The staff also didn't replenish the food promptly, e.g. didn't manage to have the cooked broccoli when it ran out. Boulevard has a coffee machine that dispenses a variety of coffee while there's only pots of coffee/tea in Cititel.Taxi: Cititel's staff are much better as they helped its guests to secure taxi which goes by meter. The first question asked by the Boulevard's staff when we approached them for a taxi was whether we want the premier taxi or a normal taxi. When we asked what's the difference, the staff informed that price for a premier taxi is double than that of a normal taxi. If the hotel wants their guests to take the premier taxi, they better train the staff to answer the question appropriately, e.g. driver speak English, go by meter, more spacious, safer because it is registered with the hotel etc. If the only difference is the price, why should we take the premier taxi? So, we asked for normal taxi and the staff told us get it ourselves at the mall's taxi queue just outside the hotel. Full stop. No more help whatsoever from the staff. The good thing is, this way, we can speak to the taxi drivers ourselves and find one we're comfortable with. The first two taxi drivers can't read/speak English but we're lucky with the third taxi who knew his way around and only charged us by the meter. All-in, we only paid RM90 for the trip to KLIA2 (including a detour to Cheras).Lift: Boulevard requires you to scan your card in the lift then you can press the button for your floor. But not all scanners are working properly.

The hotel had accede to our request for connecting room which we really appreciate. We had previously stayed at The Gardens Hotel last year.RoomThe room was comfortable and huge enough for us. It was also clean and does not have any weird smell. We were given a king size bed while my mums room a twin bed. They were comfortable and we have no issue with the beds. The room is fully carpeted which is great since we have young children running around. The LCD TV has good variety of channel however the reception for international channel was not good. The bathtub does not have any curtain thus every time we use the bathtub, the bathroom floor would be wet. The bathtub and shower cubicle is separate which is great as I dont get cold having a shower.LocationI am sure you would probably have known this hotel is connected to the mall which why we had chosen this hotel. So no problem getting anything you need especially food. The mid-valley megamall is the biggest mall I have been in KL so far. I have visited mid-valley 4 times in 3 years and I still have not venture to every parts of the mall. Traffic was terrible with traffic jam every single day. We drove so it takes us a while to eventually get to the hotel. FacilitiesThe hotel does not have an attached carpark thus we need to park at the shopping mall carpark which means we have to fight for spaces with the mall users. The swimming pool is better than The Gardens Hotel which makes us glad that we had chosen this hotel instead. The distance to the mall is also near for this hotel as compared to The Gardens Hotel. The hotel lobby is quite warm so it will be a good idea to install portable aircon at the seat area. ServiceHotel staff are courteous and friendly. All my requests are promptly met. As mentioned that the hotel lobby is quite warm thus the reception provide wet towel which is quite thoughtful. The staff are friendly to my children who are quite noisy and active.

When I tried to go to the executive floor it was not activated, Did not feel any benefits of an Executive room especially as I was located in the 11th floor. A colleague who was given the 20th floor and was booked on single superior said he even had a hand written thank you note!! Did not receive any such note eventhough my room rate was much higher.

We found staff playing football at the reception area a couple of times which may be part of hyping it up for world cup but this was distracting especially when they knock over things at the front desk. There were coffee stains on the mugs in the room and the coffee satchets were sticky to touch. The hand towel also had an obvious stain on it. The rest of the room was very clean. Our friends' room kept tripping when they checked in.

The hotel was average, not the best I've stayed in but not the worst. We didn't get to eat our breakfast in the restaurant as we had to leave too early, so the hotel made us a packed lunch, but they didn't ask about our dietary needs and didn't explain what food they had given us, we were given a sandwich an apple and a bottle of water each which we ended up chucking as we couldn't guarantee what was in the sandwiches and didn't want to cause any allergic reactions with my partner and I do not eat a lot of meats or tuna etc. so that was a waste of money to pay for breakfast in my opinion. The location served it's purpose as well, but I don't think I would stay here for an entire holiday.

After arrival at the International airport, take the train to KL Central and then taxi to the hotel. Thats the fastest and most convenient way. Mid Valley itself is a very big shopping area with tons of restaurants and coffee shops. The hotel rooms are not the newest but still OK and well maintained. Wifi access is FOC but occasionally creates troubles. The Wild Rice Restaurant (also functions as the breakfast area) was under renovation, which was inconvenient. The pool area (behind the Wild Rice restaurant) was closed and accessing the gym meant going through the construction site of the restaurant. The gym itself is OK and offers a selection of training equipment. The staff is very friendly and helpful.

'All of them are my friends in KL' quoted by my Russian friend Alex, who was very grateful to all the staff in the hotel during his stay there.Location wise it's excellent. Away from Bt Bintang, situated in Midvalley, it's just minutes away from KL Sentral and Bangsar. Although some of the rooms have be renovated, stains can still be seen in the bathroom. Cigarettes smell still quite strong in some of the non- smoking rooms/floors.

Being adjacent to Mid Valley Megamall (North Court), one of the biggest and the most popular mall in Kuala Lumpur, is by far the biggest advantage of this hotel. So, if you have anything you want to buy and or eat, you can just walk 5 minutes and find tons of choices. The (deluxe) room itself is spacious enough, the amenities are fine with the exception of the carpet that feels and looks old. The internet connection however is not consistently strong. It is annoying especially when you use it for your work, like sending files via email, downloading a report from your home staff and communicating with your home staff via skype. Because of that, your works are interrupted several times. Even worst, the last night of my stay, I struggled to get the connection. The breakfast is pretty much standard for the hotel, with some choices of local foods. Another downside of this hotel is the tv channels. They are very limited, may be 10 channels at the most and are dominated by local and sport channels. The hotel management seems to assume that all guests like these channels, which is untrue for me and several others.

Ridiculous as we left our room with the sign - make up room in situ at 9am! No apology, instead we were told they were very busy!

One night around RM330 inclusive of service tax and gov tax (W/O breakfast). Expected it will much more comfort than Cititel Hotel that I stay 2 years ago, but it disappoint me in the following points:-- Bed and pillow are not comfortable, there plenty of dirty mark on the blanket.- In room aircond was too cold until unable to sleep comfortably, increase the temperature not much help, need to switch it off to sleep.- Limited number of devices can be connected to the free WiFi (Only two devices can be connected), at first was only limited to one device, call to request for more, but was told their management only allow maximum two devices to connect. It need to key in the password frequently, ie if you left your devices idle for 15-20mins, you will have to re-type the password. Hope that the Hotel will look into this issue and improve.- In room fridge is not cold enough- Iron offered in room was old.Good points of this Hotel:-+ Easy accessible, great location for shopping, not too far to KLIA (45mins), Bukit Bintang (10-15mins), 1Utama (15mins), IKEA (15mins), Mid Valley Megamall just downstair of the Hotel.+ Big, clean, comfortable Hotel Lobby.+ Friendly staffs+ Feel secure in this Hotel, including the entrance, lift, as well as room door+ Good bathroom, basin, but the WC a bit dated (plastic start to deteriorate, yellow stain).+ Well lighted room.+ Offer free drinking water.In my opinion, the Hotel shall priced at RM265/night W/O breakfast inclusive all the tax, with what they offered.",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,Malaysia,Malaysia,Not Value For Money,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:16:29,3,Mid Valley Expressway

May be short of people as the hotel is quite busy in Dec-13. Given a room 2101 which was clean and comfortable. Great to see improvement on refurbishment and renovation in the room compared to last visit in May-13,All electrical appliances in the room and water tap in bathroom are in good working condition. I saw a card on the table which you can leave a comment and complaint if anything is not working well which i think is an excellent idea for the hotel to seek for improvement of their service.Would like to comment if they can offer more pillow choice for guest.

Charge for hotel guests is RM15 per day, and you get a voucher from the hotel for that first day, so you are nothing out. You can then move your car to the cheaper carpark for the rest of your stay. No need to wander around with heavy bags.Check in was quick and fast, bellboy brought up luggage with us, no waiting for either.Stayed in a deluxe room 2406, without breakfast. We were happy with the cleanliness of the room and bathroom, all amenities etc were good. There was a bathtub, rain shower head, and movable shower head as well. Oddly, there was no power socket for a shaver in the bathroom ( that we could see).Bed was a bit hard for me, but that is personal preference.The wireless internet was free, password included on your room number slip during checkin, so no hassle about trying to get it later. Good, fast broadband, wonderful.Our room had a connecting door, which was OK, because it could not be opened from the other side. However, this led to us being able to hear quite a bit from the next room. Soundproofing should have been better.The absolute best thing is LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION !! It is right next door to Mid Valley Megamall, and has a direct corridor access from the lobby lift area straight into the North Atrium Ground Floor.

The pool and gym area is excellent with a good sized pool that would be great to keep kids entertained. The restaurant and bar are on the same level and also nice. Breakfast served in the restaurant here had a good variety.As mentioned in other reviews the location above the Mega Mall is a real plus. There is a huge variety of shops and a heap of restaurants and food outlets. A bonus was the Gloria Jeans coffee shop almost next door.Traffic in and out of the area can be a bit of an issue at peak times, although when traffic is light it is only a 15 min taxi ride from the centre of town.

The staff were friendly and helpful when we checked in. As they were very busy at that hour, we carried our own bags up to our room (small carry-on size, so not too bad). The room was clean and quite comfortable. The bathtub was separate from the shower section (with an overhead rain shower and small handheld shower-head). When I left, the hotel taxis were all busy (or stuck in the KL traffic!), but the hotel staff kindly diverted a regular taxi away from the busy taxi rank outside the mall.

Nice bathroom too.Friendly staff. In-spite of the strict letter about checkout times and extra payment if you are late to check out that I found in my room; the girl at the lobby told me to not worry, and that it was OK if I was a little bit late, since I needed to finish a few things in town before coming back to check out. And this is not the only example.Nice gym.Very good breakfast, with nice local and western selection.Taxi station right as you walk out from the lobby.One of the largest malls in Asia, with all of the dining and shopping you can think about, right as you walk out the elevator at the lobby level. Including a large supermarket where you can stock you room fridge with what you need at street price rather than hotel price.Room safe bolted down.Very affordable rate.So so:You will get some street noise even at 20th floor. Windows seem to be made of single pane with no noise insulation. It can be so-so or bad, depending on your sensitivity. I was kind of OK with that, maybe because I like everything else. I am not sure if there is a better side with less noise due to the central location of the hotel. Maybe others commented on that.Pool is out door (which is fine) but shallow. I did not use it because of that, and mostly saw kids playing in it. (Which is important too...)All in all very good.

The price is very reasonable.Location:Located in a mega-mall away from downtown area. So, if you're a first time visitor, this may not be the best located hotel for you. However, it's a MYR$12 cab ride from KL Sentral station (town center station for KLIA express train from airport which costs MYR$70 return for one adult) and a few commuter train stops to the downtown area (commuter train station located just outside the mall, level 1 northside). Cabs are cheap and plentiful. There's a cab rank just outside the hotel, but beware some of the cabbies will ask for fix price to a destination rather than using the taximeter, or will add $2 to the fare, just a rip-off. You can say no and get out of the cab. A second cab rank at south end of the mall, or hail one on the street.Security: there's no secure card-only access to the floors, but it's in a mall, so security isn't so bad.Room: Rm2410 was a bit dated. The carpet had a huge iron burn mark on it and was a bit dirty. There were hair on the bathroom floor, but otherwise OK. The bed was very firm, but the bedsheets were clean. Free internet, bottled water and daily newspaper. Small unstocked bar fridge for your convenience. Complimentary fruit too. Air-conditioned. No smells. Non-smoking floors available.Dining options: The buffet breakfast on level 9 would have cost me MYR$19/day at check-in or MYR$42/day later on. Don't bother. You can eat cheaper and better elsewhere in the mall, unless you can't do without cereal. There's plentiful local breakfast cuisine to choose from in the mall, usually open at 8am, ground level northside of mall near hotel; in the basement level of Gardens mall eg Nonya Colours (mee siam delicious!); or level 1 Northside. Give the local food a go! eg mee siam, nasi lemak, kaya toast, local coffee, local kueh etc. For lunch or dinner, there are even more options in the mall, take your pick, there's more on the Garden mall side. There's a supermarket on the basement level too.Shopping:Shop-til-ya-drop. This mall has loads to see.

My first visit was relatively pleasant and i found the location which is just adjacent to Midvalley Megamall & The Gardens SUPER convenient.. no hassle of scrambling around for parking, (hotel jockey is RM15 per ENTRY mind you) and even if i don't take up the free breakfast, i am at ease to know that i've got plenty of eateries lined up for me next door which is only an escalator away.. Can't say how much I loved this advantage. I booked everything online and they even accommodated my late check in (9pm!) just fine.. easy check in and smooth check out.. love it.My 2nd trip however wasn't as pleasant, as our very first encounter at the lobby was with one very sulky looking bellboy.. who pouted all the way to the room as he found all my luggages (all 6 of em tho..) a big nuisance. I had half a mind to skip the tip but decided on it anyway.. and only THEN did he give me a smile.. i mean, i wasnt expecting such attitude from the hotel staff. And as we entered our deluxe, we found there was absolutely no refreshments at all.. not even a single bottle of mineral water.. and to top it off, our toilet bidet was completely useless and broken.. So, minus 2 for Boulevard.. they did however, respond to our housekeeping call quite efficiently. They had it all fixed in 15 mins. When asked bout the refreshments.. the receptionist just gave me a raised brow.. no apologies, no explanation given. All they did was placed a single mineral water bottle in the room when we got back, when i clearly stated i was checking in for 3... hmm...But anyhow, i can state that this hotel does supply quite a complete set of amenities and you could probably want for nothing more in terms of basic needs. Toothbrush, shaver, cotton buds, Shower gel, etc.. like i said, all your BASIC needs. I also find the ready iron and ironing board in each room is just wonderful.. WIFI was a bit slow but passable..TV channels were adequate but poor sound system.. well, all in all, acceptable.

The stay started off on a good note as they upgraded us to a superior executive room from a superior room, as our room was not cleaned yet when we arrived. Special mention goes to front desk staff Umi, for her friendliness and helpfulness.Room amenities were plenty and of a good standard. Bed was a bit too hard for my liking, but not too shabby.In-room dining was fine and the food was yummy, although I wish they had a bit more variety. Same goes for the buffet breakfast.The hotel is linked to a mall by a passageway beside the lift lobby, so shopaholics, rejoice! With the falling ringgit rate, now is definitely the time to shop! :)The hotel is also just beside the KTM Mid-valley station (there's a bridge that links to the station from the Mid-Valley mall), so hop on the train to get to Bukit Bintang or KLCC.Overall, I would recommend this hotel!",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,Singapore,Malaysia,A surprise gem!,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:16:36,5,Mid Valley Expressway

There were also many TV channels such as Discovery, Fox Movies and so forth. All in all a great stay.

The service was very good, courteous and efficient from the front of house staff manning the desk and the room service staff were very nice and pretty quick at bringing the food.In general the rooms are good although behind the curtains mine had quite a lot of mould - everywhere else was clean and no sign of previous guests' mess which is good.The bed was VERY comfy and an excellent size - the TV wasn't bad but naturally veers towards what is available for local and chinese stations. I don't object to this, if I wanted to watch the BBC I'd have stayed in England!The room service food (supplied by the attached 'Wild Rice' Restaurant) was a mixed bag. The amount was plentiful and I'd say well priced but the quality varied. I enjoyed a good Mee Mamak but the Nasi Goreng wasn't great. A burger did the job but didn't taste like particularly good quality meat was being used.Breakfast at the Executive Lounge on floor 26 was good - lots of choice and eat as much as you like (at that time in the morning, that wasn't much)Overall, it's well recommended and well located for Mid Valley - I wouldn't say it was the ideal location for the centre of KL as the KTM Kommuter isn't the fastest line but it's only one stop away from KL Sentral and from there your options are limitless!",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,"Halifax, United Kingdom",Malaysia,"Good location, service and rooms - not perfect",Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:16:38,4,Mid Valley Expressway

59200,selvisur,2013-08-22,"booked two rooms with the hotel, only to be informed upon arrival that only smoking floor rooms were available, so i hesitated, but was the receptionist tried to convince me that the floor was newly renovated so the smell would not be that bad.. not two minutes of considering and i agreed, when again being informed that my rooms have been taken by someone else already. i asked how could that be possible when i was standing right in front of her and was offered those rooms and not even taking long to decide. then i was offered rooms on different floor which i said would be very inconvenient, but the receptionist insist there wasn't any room left so yeah, in the end, my parents and I had to be separated by 3 floors, them in 18th, i was placed in 15th.after that, really didn't expect much in terms of anything, only when i went out to a mall that I realized that I had left my wallet inside my hotel room when I took it out for some tip money for the room cleaning person. I had about 5000rm inside the wallet and was really getting worried the moment I found out. I took a taxi back to the hotel, and really, the wallet was intact, nicely placed on the bedside table. For this, I am truly grateful and impressed by the honesty of the cleaning service. and worst experience was there is a small desk next to reception desk where people could book taxi/limo to go some place or airport. Now, I don't know if it is hotel operated or other company in cooperation with the hotel but this is truly shady behavior. I was approached by the Indian lady from the taxi desk to ask if I need a taxi, so I said yes I do need one for my parents for the day, and another one for me the next day. She said the executive/nicer taxi is 150rm for a trip to the airport, and i said i would think about it. (As there is a taxi line up just outside the hotel and i was told by the shopkeepers in the mall that usually it's around 80rm for a normal taxi to the airport). All of the sudden, the Indian lady again offered that if I don't want the more expensive taxi, she could get me a normal one (type exora, i googled the car type and it is a pretty decent type) for 100rm, and I agreed. Then she came again saying exora is booked out, if my parents would like the executive taxi, there is one driver willing to go for 110rm, and that's done. All nice and good up to this point albeit the back and forth. So i told her that if she could get me a 110rm executive taxi for the next day, then i'll confirm booking as well. She couldn't confirm right away and took my hotel room number and said she would inform me later that night. I got a phone call in my room at 11 pm at night, fairly sleepy and about to sleep and she said she couldn't get me an executive one, but there is one Exora (please google to know what i mean) willing to drive me for 100rm, and i said fine then, ok and deal and she gave me the plate number. Next morning when i was processing check out, the Indian lady was nowhere to be seen, so i simply gave the plate number to the concierge to ask him to locate the taxi. To my utter surprise and horror, which I couldn't believe my eyes and rechecking a few times that the plate number did match, the taxi waiting for me was of a very old sedan model which normally i really steer clear from. It is even worse than the ones standing at the mall taxi stand outside the hotel. I was enraged and feared for my safety, stalling between cancelling the taxi or not. But the taxi driver was kind and very polite and very probably he didn't know that I have been duped by the Indian lady so I didn't have the heart to not board his taxi. i am safely home now, but for a tourist who is not familiar with a new place, a hotel should provide the safest and trustworthy service to give piece of mind to their occupants. Not some unethical service desk inside the hotel, whether run by them or not. NOTE: if you choose this hotel because of the location, and don't mind paying the bit extra, go for The Gardens hotel, it is also connected to the mall and by far more professional.

At first we were put into an un-renovated part of the hotel, which was in desperate need of an update. We complained and got moved to a renovated deluxe room, which had been completed to a good standard and was clean.

It did not cost a great deal more to upgrade and was well worth the additional money.We only ate breakfast in the hotel, which we took in the executive lounge. There was a good choice. The lounge also offered pre-dinner drinks and snacks.The hotel was close to the main sites and didnt cost a great deal to travel around by taxi. It was a good base for exploring and good value for money.We used the pool on 1 occasion and it was cool and clean.Whilst in KL visit the hawker stalls in Jalan Alor and also the stalls set up in the basement of Lot 10, the food is amazing at great prices.The Petronas Towers is a must, together with the bird sanctuary, china town etc.RegardsSteve and Sandy Jones",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,"Chester, United Kingdom",Malaysia,Mixing pleasure with business,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:16:39,3,Mid Valley Expressway

However, this time I rate this hotel ""Poor"" instead of ""Very Good"" due to some untolerable reasons :a. We were first allocated to a newly renovated room, which is totally refreshing and bright. However, due to the smell of the paint too strong, staying in the room just for a mere 30 minutes caused us headache and nose felt pain. We called to request a room change and we waited 20 minutes but no response. So, we went down to the lobby and requested them to arrange while we go for a lunch. However, after returning from lunch (about 50 minutes or less), the staff hadn't arrange until we asked about the status. Only then the staff arranged it while we were standing in front of her. We waited almost 20 minutes only then we got another room. We are not happy for their slow response as that day the reception didn't seem to be that busy.b. We requested for a morning call for the next morning. However, they did not made that call. And we too relied on them that we did not set alarm clock by ourselves. As from previous experience, they always made the call whenever we requested for it. This caused us to woke up on our own which is 60 MINUTES late and caused us only having a mere 30 minutes for the buffet breakfast and to meeting which at first we planned to have a relaxing breakfast before going for the meeting. Imagine that if we did not set such big time frame for breakfast and late for the meeting or miss our flight... how are they going to compensate on that? We were truly UNHAPPY with thisc. For the past few years, they always up-graded us to the Deluxe room but we didn't get it this round. I guess it is due to the change of new management.

59200,KaylenM,2013-07-30,"My company booked this hotel and I will likely have to stay there again, but I'm honestly not a fan.The good:It's attached to the mega mall so if you ever need anything-it's very easy to run get something. The food options in the mega mall are vast.There are always taxis waiting out front and all taxi drivers in other parts of the city knew exactly where I wanted to go when I was ready to return to the hotel.I had a spacious room - I'm not sure what level I had-superior or whatnot, but I enjoyed having so much space.The reception and door staff are VERY friendly.I could not figure out how to make the main shower head come on and called down thinking it was broken. They sent someone up within the hour and were very kind to me when it was found to be user error!The last 4 days of my stay, there was a fruit left in my room with a little note about why it's good for you. It was much appreciated.The bad:It is not in a location where you can walk to any other part of the city.The restaurant overlooks the pool, as does part of the gym. For someone who might be a little shy, this is a huge problem. I did not want an audience while exercising so I did not get the opportunity to use the pool which was frustrating because I actually had time and desire to do so.The restaurant in the hotel is very pricey and does not put the customer first. For example, I wanted a chicken dinner which came with vegetables, for a price of 27RM. They came back to me a few min after placing the order and told me the chicken was not available. I ordered something else but asked for a side of veggies-which is an option when you order the lamb or ribs. They brought me a less-than-average bowl of vegetables (most of which I didn't think tasted good) and charged me 21RM. The service was horrible and the manager did not care about my dissatisfaction with the price of the vegetables. I was shocked as most places I have been to in Asia are very quick to make the customer happy with their food.Just fyi- the breakfast buffet has no traditional American breakfast items, aside from toast. They have a lot of offerings, but it's just not the typical and I opted to skip it and purchase food elsewhere (though it was included in the room costs). There was mold in my shower.There was a large brown carpet stain right in the main walkway of my living area.The elevator/lift (at least one of them) makes a VERY loud grinding metal noise nonstop. I was barely in my room the first few days so just tolerated it, thinking it was temporary. It never stopped though-so I called the front desk. The first night I called at 8:30pm and they said they would look into it. The next night I called at 8:45pm and they said it was the elevator and they would stop the noise. The following night, I waited til 9pm, and they said they would shut the elevator down for the night. It seemed as if they were not fixing it but just letting it run during the day until someone complained. I worked in my hotel room for part of a couple afternoons and had to listen to it the entire time - it was so loud that the person on my Skype meeting call could actually hear it in the background. I really hope that this was a new problem they had not yet had the chance to get fixed, but I was surprised that it was not shut down at an earlier hour.There is no dresser and very few hangers (until you have laundry service). I was staying for 9 nights and would have liked to unpack from my suitcase, but there was nowhere to put my stuff. There are two small drawers at the bottom of a cupboard, but I wasn't really sure what those were for-certainly not very many clothes would fit in there.I have never stayed at a hotel with so few channels. Only 13 total. I think there were 5 English stations (not counting the 1-2 for children), and 2 of the 5 English channels were not clear about 50% of the time.",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,"Tualatin, Oregon, United States",Malaysia,Not what I was expecting,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:16:42,3,Mid Valley Expressway

One of our bathroom was smelly but we decided not to complain since we did not fancy changing rooms and we were staying for two nights only. So, we made use of one bathroom most of the time.

Its officially a four star but I struggle to tell the difference.Location - Great and connected to one of KL's biggest shopping malls.Rooms - (Executive) In very good condition, bed very comfortable and air-conditioning settings are accurate.Food - Very good (and of great value)Amenities - Swimming Pool and Restaurants - Very goodExecutive Lounge - Probably room from improvement here, the area looks ""tired"" and in need of a refresh, the food selection etc looks like its there because someone say its has to be there, rather than to entice the client. Drink selection very very limited.Service - Staff are friendly, reliable and demonstrate client centricityReception - Arrival process.

A beautifully located hotel with gorgeous rooms and wonderful views of the city it is also connected to a GIGANTIC Mall with over 600 stores of all kinds. My sister is quite the shopaholic and she had an absolute blast.The service at the hotel is fantastic with a friendly and welcoming staff. Check in was a breeze and the service prompt.

In terms of convenience, there is a large shopping mall right next to this hotel which makes it easy - for food and also some shopping. But shops are targeted at mid market so don't expect brands.

Things that made us wonder was the welcome fruit that's ready in our room were only two bananas which gave us an impression that was the left overs. I was expecting more variety of fruit when you highlighted ""Welcome Fruit Platter"" in your website. Had breakfast at the executive lounge (I think so as no one bother to serve us when we were there), and we just walked in ourselves and help ourselves without anyone serving us or bother to check on us. Breakfast was basic, not many choices but just to fill you up. That doesn't bother us too much as the hotel is just next to the shopping center which you can have more variety of food from there.Overall the stay was really satisfying (except for the fruit platter) with the acceptable price for the excellent room and convenient location.",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,australia,Malaysia,Nice Hotel with Nice View,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:16:46,4,Mid Valley Expressway
59200,csgohan4,2013-05-31,"Chose here due to location, transport links and excellent reviews on here. Check in:After a 15 hour flight, the last thing I need is grief at Check in. Thankfully none was found and it was smooth and encountered no problems. Bell boy escorted our luggage to our rooms promptly and in a timely manner, tipped him at the end.Room:We had a deluxe room, it was exactly what we needed. Larger super king sized bed which was extremely comfortable, clean and large.We had a desk with 2 chairs and a coffee table. A large 30 inch Sony TV with non Cable channels, quality of which vary both in quality and reception.They provided some tea sugar and on occasion some fruit such as 2 large apples. A fridge was also provided which thankfully free from the usual premium rip off alcohol that no-one touches, so we could put some more fruit and food in there. They provided a hairdryer, iron and ironing board together with a small Kettle. 1.5L of mineral water is provided every day, but the reception said the tap water is drinkable, although I wouldn't recommend it though. Our room we had a nice view over the city and the room was nicely cooled by air con which you can set the temperature of. Bathroom:Comprised of a bathtub AND walk in glass shower which was excellent. It was also medium in sized and big enough for my needs. They change towels every day if needed and provided bath, face and hand towels, two each. Together with standard stuff like soap and bath additives. Internet:Estimated at about 2.5MBPS with downloads of 370KB/s using P2P, so more than adequate and much less restrictive than your usual rubbish dial up speeds and endless ads. Although you can only connect two devices at a time. Importantly it's included in the price. Room service:The food menu was reasonable in terms of variety, and we tried the seafood noodles which was very good and surprised me given it was room service. The kitchen is 24 hours which is convenient given I arrived at around 10pm+ and everywhere was closed. Facilities:They had an out door swimming pool which is about half Olympic size which is decent and a fully stocked and MODERN gym. About 4 treadmills, 4 Cross trainers and various other weight/ resistance machines. Plenty of weights too. So more than enough to keep you happy together with a complimentary pool towel if needed. Restaurant:This was quite big and we tried the buffet lunch just to see what it was like. I believe it was around 50 RM per person. The buffet variety was in my opinion limited and the food was ok, not fantastic. If you want a decent buffet style meal go to Shangri-La or Mandarin Hotel. You will find better food in the mall , but avoid some of the food courts as they are not all that good. The food court opposite Cold storage in the nicer part of the mall is not bad. Departure:They have their own taxi service who can transport your luggage to the airport if necessary but I tend to use the official KLIA airport company as they are cheaper. Make sure you pick up the card from the airport so you have their number. Summary:All in all my stay here for 1 week was enjoyable and the service by the staff at the Boulevard was excellent and I shall return here for sure.",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,"London, United Kingdom",Malaysia,Fantastic and worth the stay,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:16:46,5,Mid Valley Expressway

The only thing is, if you arrive by car, you have to park in the Megamall parking (go for G), and it's best to work out beforehand which end is nearer to the hotel entrance because you'll have to drag your bags through the mall itself. The hotel entrance is at the ground floor at one end of the mall, so if you're parked at a higher level, take the lift down first. Within the mall, the route to the lobby is VERY understated, that you might think you're headed to the washrooms or staff elevators - could be better signed. Also, the parking layout is inconvenient - to get out again you have to drive all the way up and then all the way down as there's no pass-through to the downward ramps. If you are here on holiday via public transport/taxi, then this issue is not a problem as you can be dropped off/enter via the road side of the lobby, which is nice enough.

The Gardens is touted as a five star property and the Boulevard is a four star. I managed to get a good price on the Hotel's website. The Boulevard is also adjacent the Mid Valley Mall so the location is fantastic especially for shopping and dining.There is nothing grand about the Boulevard but the room is nice and clean. My request for non smoking, King sized bed and high floors were all met which is nice. I was on the highest floor, 28th. The bathroom has no bath, just a shower. There is free wifi but having to sign in constantly with the room number and a 6 digit password was a real pain.The resort has a plain looking rectangle swimming pool with a constant dept of 1.2m. I noticed there were broken tiles at the pool floor exposing dirt or cement and was unsightly.If you are after a quick breakfast, you can have two half boiled eggs, toast and coffee for just RM5 (US$1.60) plus 16% taxes at the Wild Rice cafe on the 9th floor. That is very good value.My flight left at midnight. I requested for a late checkout and the hotel wanted to charge me 50% of the published rate. I negotiated to pay RM150 and held on to the room till 9pm. Special mentioned to housekeeping.

This was a real bonus - free internet, free coffee and soft drinks all day, free afternoon canapes, free beer, wine, eats for 2+ hours at dinner time. The staff on this level were just so efficient and friendly.Having stayed there just a couple of weeks ago my memories of the Boulevard Hotel remain fresh in my mind. Definitely worth it's four star status as I couldn't find a single fault with anything there. What made my four day stay even more memorable was friendliness of the staff who often went out of their way to do things or get things for you.The Mega Mall and Gardens Mall next door have to be seen to be believed, sheer paradise for the avid shopper - my wife was blown away by the variety and excellent prices on offer. The food in the restaurant of the hotel was excellent but next door in the mall the choice of eateries and restaurants was maddening. No excuse for going hungry as my now expanded waistline will testify to.If you needed to venture out to Bukit Bintang, just take a red cab outside the front of the hotel - cost 10myr for about a 15 min trip.Liked  Good accommodation, good shopping and great staffDisliked  Perhaps the hardness of the king bed",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,"Brisbane, Australia",Malaysia,Just a nice hotel,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:16:48,5,Mid Valley Expressway

Room has no bathrobes, towels were a bit on the thin side, and it could be bath sheets instead of bath towels. The shower button was not easy to operate. Bed mattress was extremely firm, not sure if they were orthopaedic beds. On the plus side, the housekeeper for room 2315 was very clean, although we did not meet her. Walking distance to shops. You name it, it's all there. The Gardens have more trendy, expensive, designer goods whereas in the Mall, (all walking distance) there is a mixture of local and overseas goods. Food courts are everywhere in the Mall. One area is next to Machines (Apple shop). Food is okay. The one thing I am not so keen on is the use of the cutlery, although washed, is still wet and that really puts me off. Might as well have plastic cutlery wrapped in paper. Having said that, I was not sick that day or the next, so it is pretty safe. Hairdressers. Various prices as you need to shop around to get the best deal. Did not have time to go to the spa or pool so could not comment. Watch out for the budget taxis. We had a chatty Indian guy. Unfortunately, his taxi had limited luggage space, so the boot was left unlock and open. A bit worrying to have your luggages at the back on the taxi, not knowing if any had fallen off on the way to the International airport. He even had the audacity to stop to go to the loo!!

59200,CDKThane,2013-03-12,I was on a business trip in KL during the month of March 2012. I stayed in this hotel for 3 nightsThis hotel inliterally inside the Mid-valley mall in KL. The beauty of well-laid out Mall and hotel is experienced here. one can literally get inside a mall from reception of the hotel.I was offered an upgrade to suite with 100 MYR more per day. I stayed on the 28th floor suite with a nice view. A separate lounge for breakfast was available ( for suite members). Food was good and plenty. I did face issues with the wireless though ! signal was low and it was not working well.Overall impression was value of money.,The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,Thane- Maharashtra,Malaysia,Comfortable & convenient stay,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:16:52,4,Mid Valley Expressway

Not much food options in room menu if you get in very late at night.Surrounding area includes 2 large malls. One catering for normal shopping and one for high end items. Few good bars and restaurants nearby.Taxi point outside hotel to take you into central KL but remember stay in queue if you want metered taxi at reasonable price.

And I decided to speak to the General Manager once I arrive. I arrived at the hotel at 3.30 PM, and I've attend by the front office manager ms Zulaini, and he concern about it.. The GM also try to make our dissapoiment as a pleasure stay as he send the fruits, and apology letter which i really appreciate. Everything was perfect before and along of our stayed at the hotel, untill the incident happen, the lady named Linda had never come to us and apologised for what has happen, and she still showing her rudeness to me whenever I showed up at the reception counter. Is this the staff that can be a rolled model to staff as she is the DUTY MANAGER!! She's making my stay at the hotel feel like unpleasant..

59200,jg161,2013-03-09,"Hotel located right next to the mid valley mall with no issues for transport. Check-in was fast but a bit difficult due to multiple reservations, this is my fault for having two reservations but ultimately meant I threw away my upgraded room for the 2nd night because it was just too hard to discuss it. Check out was super fast.Room was appointed in basic standard fashion, 2 bottles of water, some slippers and a small set of bathroom amenities. The bed is comfortable and of medium-to-hard firmness with a nice set of pillows.Bathroom was clean and In the type of room I had, shower of average size, with washing line. On the down side for the room they do need a refresh as they are looking quite tired. My room in particular could have done with some minor maintenance etc. Having said that, the desk had a notice that the hotel is undertaking renovation at the moment, I would say they are already taking care of it.Didn't get up in time to check the breakfast, but the bar is open 24 hours, which is nice if you want to sit and have a beer if you get home late from business.Review is slightly on the lower side as I expected it to be a bit better based on other reviews here, would have liked to give 3.5 dots.

59200,neilsolaris,2012-12-11,"After reading some of the previous reviews, I can only assume that all three of the rooms I stayed in over the past three weeks were the upgraded ones. They seemed nicely decorated, clean and attractive. I was worried the bed would be too hard for me at first, but actually it was very comfortable. The aircon was very effective, so much so that I had to put my jumper on a couple of times. When I had problem getting cold water from the tap once, the maintenance guy came up straight away and fixed it.The view from the room was great, especially when I had one facing the swimming pool.The highlight for me was the swimming pool, as I love swimming. It is a very good length (about 30 metres), and most the time there was hardly anyone else in it, so ideal for lap swimming. The breakfast was very good, with lots of choice. I liked eating outside, with the fish swimming behind me!The staff were all very friendly.I didn't choose or pay for this hotel. Although the hotel was great, it wouldn't be my first choice of location. If you are into shopping then it couldn't be better. But I find shopping centres quite boring, and would have preferred to stay somewhere with more character (such as Bukit Bintang), but it's only a 5 minute train ride to KL Sentral station.

59200,Travelling_Teddies,2012-10-22,"Stayed here over the Moto GP weekend in KL. Rooms left were rather limited, and the prices were a little steep. We had a friend who recommended us this hotel in the past, but we tried the others in the vicinity first before going for this one. Must say that for the price we paid, which was S$150 per night, the room was rather disappointing.Wasn't expecting much of course - my yardstick has always been clean rooms and toilet, soft bed... but while Boulevard is central in its location at Mid Valley Mall, its lacklustre rooms are in need of a good makeover.Furniture is tired, even though if maintained well, it could look like a modern concept room... but no... tired is the word. They replaced the 1980s box tv with an LCD so that's 1 positive point. The toilet is nothing impressive. Very basic toilet plus standing shower room, tub, mirror and sink. Needs some good 'ol scrubbing as the tiles are grimy. I don't get hotels who don't scrub grime - don't they clean and scrub it every day? Breakfast is good. For RM 19, the quality and spread is pretty decent. Even though you are surrounded by so many choices of food at the mall, the hotel breakfast is pretty worth the cheap price you paid - they have malay food, indian, chinese, oats, cereal, variety of cheeses and a list of morning beverages..... you name it, they have it.Now the bed... The bed was very very hard ladies and gentlemen, so hard it gave me a massive backache and i was awake all night crying about how painful my back was lying down. So painful that i cannot stand or sit for too long after that, without the pain bothering me. At some point, i had to sit and sleep (which was better than lying down). Not a good night's rest at all and really, the only thing that puts me off from ever coming back is the bed. Sorry guys... Can't sleep in the bed at the hotel - just won't do it for me. I think you can get better deals with other hotels surrounding the vicinity, that are reasonably priced and with good rooms. Note that Boulevard Hotel is priced in mid-range.

I was upset and must complain to the manager. After that the manager changed us the room and gave us some complimentary to show her apologies. So I was a bit cool off. I did not want to make a big complaint, but I shall get what I have paid for. Anyway, the front manager handled the complaint well and satisfy the customer.Bad experiences were not over. The maid did not refill any amenities, no shower gel or shampoo was refilled. Last night at 4 am, there was chemical smell in our room. I thought I was dreaming, but I woke up with my wife at 5 am. Then I opened the door to check the smell in the hallway, same smell was there too. I called the reception. She told me, there was renovation in the kitchen. So I asked that we need to open ventilation window as the chemical smell burns our noses. So the technician came up and sprayed refresher all the room. I must tell him to stop!!! I wanted to open ventilation window, do not spray anything in my room. He didn't stop? What the hell?It took 1 hour before it gets fresher air. My wife and I want to go out of the hotel, but we decide not to.

Otherwise KTM is walking distance through the mall. I strongly advise not to use the train during peak hours. Really congested and may have to squeeze through crowds.I tried the suite for the first time yesterday and very pleased with the extra services for the tea and dinner at the executive lounge level 25. Room was very nice for the suite. Have stayed at the standard room many times before and find it good and clean also.If you can afford it, i highly recommend the suite, as you can have free flow of drinks (incld. alcohol) at the lounge and free finger foods, so it will compensate on the additional cost.",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,Kuching,Malaysia,Great Location & Clean,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:17:01,4,Mid Valley Expressway

Once we for the children in to the lobby the concierge helped my husband with the two boys to two chairs so they could keep sleeping. There was an issue with our booking instead having an executive interconnecting room we had two separate rooms. With the children being so young this was not acceptable, the reservations clerk was very accomadating and so was Andy the duty manager.

If you don't need to be at the KL city centre, Mid Valley is a location worth considering. Mid Valley City is to the west of the city centre and conveniently located for some of the suburban zones of Klang Valley. I've also stayed at Cititel, which is in the same complex, and this seems to be a little more upmarket.No complaints. It was reasonably priced and everything was of a decent enough standard. Breakfast hint: no need to pay extra for the breakfast buffet if you are not a big eater, as there are enough options in the mall. There is a Toast Box (traditional soft-boiled eggs and kaya toast) just as you enter the mall from the hotel.

59200,mdodd1985,2012-06-08,The hotel has seen better days. I stayed there about 6 years ago and was so impressed that I thought I would return for my mum's birthday celebrations. When we got there we had an agonising wait to get to our rooms. We discovered that we had been upgraded to a premium suite. Well that isn't how i Would describe a room with tired old sofas scuffed walls and the wardrobe door hanging off. Then we discovered that they had only upgraded one room and put my mother in a normal room! I brought this to their attention and they moved our rooms by locking us away from our possessions and making me play bellboy by moving out of the rooms. In the end it was 6 in the evening before we were settled in our rooms. The rooms were okay for the price paid but in such a state of neglect that you struggled to find something that was working properly! We made the most of our stay by using mega mall and it's entertainment as our celebrations. I would probably not return to this hotel and suggest that they are downgraded to a 3 star hotel.,The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,"Hedge End, United Kingdom",Malaysia,They ruined our birthday celebrations!,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:17:04,3,Mid Valley Expressway
59200,chilicandy,2012-06-08,"i stayed here with my family in December 2010. My family size is 7 people, which consist of me, my husband, 4 kids and my mom. So we took the Executive suite with attached deluxe room. We are from KL, and thinking to celebrate Christmast day at the hotel, and do some shopping in MIdvalley. The setback were, there's no car park facility provided. So, if you are a Malaysian or Singaporean/Thais driving with own car, you have to pay your own parking fees per day/entrance, using the Midvalley's parking. This were not expected, if i had known this i would have give this Boulevard a miss. For this is the first hotel in Malaysia that never provide any parking facility.The second setback was, the card were deactivated right after 11 am. That is one hour before check out. How stupid is that ? We have to use the card to access the lift to our room and enter our room. We were at the pool and going up to our room past 11 am, and we were denied entry. All of us, with my kids dripping wet, and have to withstand the air cond at the lobby, and the lobby front desk with only few staff were too BUSY to bother with our complaints.We were ignored, until my husband has to raises his voice to get attention. How inept are the staff to notice that their guest were all wet in swimming suits, and trying to get help ?Some staff at the Gym where we get our towels for the pool were eyeing us with 'untrusted' eyes, like we would sneak away their towels. Keeps coming to tells us everytime he sees us. ( i had forgotten his name by now ).My family were very upset about this. And i should have written a formal complaint to the management back then.

For som reason, it has deteriorated not only in its appearance (which is understandable), maintenance, and service.The rooms look tired. Twice, the carpet in my room was either wet or sticky. The bedsheets were not very clean. Service-wise, things could be improved. Once, I was locked in the bathroom because the bathroom lock was defective; no apology at all from management. The biggest issue with the hotel is the taxi service. They try to push the hotel taxi service which is o be expected. Otherwise, you would need to queue up by the taxi stand just across the hotel here drivers refuse to use the meter and quote exorbitant prices. Twice, I booked a hotel taxi and despite the confirmation was told they were not available; I was then introduced to a taxi driver waiting by the stand who despite his filthy vehicle, quoted me a rate the same as Despite having 5 elevators, they are not programmed to be efficient. Elevators could all be servicing the same floors and stopping at each floor, just like a bus, even when passengers have already been picked up by earlier elevators.

Mid valley and the Garden's mall is just right next to it so it was very convenient. However I would like to comment the road leading from The Garden's mall towards the hotel lobby is very dark. We were walking back after karaoke at 3am, all the shops are closed. Although the area is very safe, there are guards everywhere but still it will be better to light it up. Although the bathroom was beautiful, the marble floor was easily flooded as the water from the shower overflowed outside the cubicle.

Problem is that only one logon is allowed per room. I left my laptop running in the room and could not logon to the wifi in the lounge on my smart phone.The pool & gym looked nice but I never had time to use them. The spa is managed by a third party and if I am not mistaken, it is for men only ;)Suggestions for improvement:1. Allow 2 internet logons per room so guests can use their notebook and smart phone at the same time.2. Update the card system to touch card instead of the 20th century swipe card for better guest convenience.3. Start planning a refurb program to keep the decor up-to-date.4.

Plus a parking fee of RM5, that is very inappropriate, guest should be given free parking!2- The table & chair inside the room look old, please replace them.3- The tv had 20 channels but the picture ratio are out of order.4- Free internet access is provided in the room buy I have to call reception to get the username & password, I taught this info should have been given to me during check in.5- Your hotel first impression fail me, the first thing I saw when I arrived is two of your bell boy was sitting on the floor beside the main door of the hotel & did not have the intend to help me with my luggage.Anyway this hotel is a fantastic stay for those who crave for retail therapy.

After reading other reviewer's review, I thought choosing this should be a right choice but it has fall short of my expectation. We drove to Boulevard Hotel from Singapore and took quite a while to find Zone H to park our car. The traffic is terrible around Mid-Valley regardless of time/day. We have to lug our luggages as it's quite a distance from the hotel lobby. Parking is RM$5/day. Check-in was very fast and it was much later I realised that the guy from reception didn't ask me for my credit card and it resulted me having to pay for in-room dining and others payable on the spot. My room has many flaws (bathtub has cracks with rust, clothes line is spolit,missing lamp shade makes the bulb very glaring) I asked for another room but they said they're fully booked and will try for me tomorrow. I decided to stay put since it's only for 3 days. The bed is uncomfortable as it's a wooden bed with 4 wheels. But I liked the housekeeping which is very quick and prompt with our requests. The shopping centre connected to this hotel is great too. It's very convenient esp when we shopped with our children and they wants to take a quick nap. Breakfast is standard and we had to pay for our children's breakfast as only 2 free breakfast is included in my booking.

Despite a minor glitch where my room was not promised a complimentary wireless access in the room as stated in my hotel voucher given by a hotel booking website, the staff at Boulevard exercised their 'guest-first' approach by extending the complimentary Internet access despite it being against what they normally provide for the guest. Besides the flexibility they displayed, they did it with impeccable manners and graciousness, a sign that the staff have been well-trained. Rooms were clean and smelled fresh. Slight area for improvement would be in the quality of toiletries they provide- toothpaste tasted weird- and in their lack of changing of fresh towels on a daily basis. Water pressure was strong and heater works wonderfully. However, breakfast was acceptable by international standards and response to housekeeping service was prompt (within 10 minutes for a yukata).

Beds feel new, they definitely dont sink it, good for a night's sleep. With a common bath and shower, i think it doesnt really matter, although a seperate one will be more ideal. Internet access is constant throughout, and there is no difficulty in having to surf any kind of site. Their IPs are relatively open. TV's great, wide variety in New, Documentaries, Kids and also their Hongkong channel cable, which is a direct telecast from there. I usually watch alot of TV to unwind so thats great for me. A small reading light also serves as its own purpose for each side of the bed, promising that i wont disturb my partner while reading and no other lights needs to be further turned on.

Since my meeting was at that hotel I decided to stay at the nearest hotel, that is, Boulevard Hotel. The corporate price of the room was only slightly cheaper than at the Gardens BUT the ambiance at Boulevard left very much to be desired.The cons I noticed are:(1) when I entered my room it smelled of stale smoke;(2) the room was dated. However the amenities were in good working order;(3) the breakfast was palatable but the refilling was slow; and(4) the staff (from reception to F&B to Housekeeping) need to be given serious training in customers' service. Remember that in the hotel industry a superior service mindset is very critical as that is how you leave a great impression on your guests for which they will return or recommend their friends / relatives to patronize your hotel.I hope management takes notice of these feedback. My intention in writing this feedback is that I know both hotels belong to the same group and as such in order to maintain consistency in all your hotels you need to ensure these areas are addressed. Needless to say I will continue to stay at Gardens Hotel on my scheduled monthly visit to KL.

Great location - right next to the North Court of the MidValley Megamall.Getting here was easy enough: KLIA Expres train (35 RM) from KLIA to KL Sentral (30 minutes, with free Wi-Fi on-route). Transfer to the KLM Komuter line at KL Sentral - one stop to MidValley (in the Seremban / Sungai Gadut direction) for 1 RM only. (At Sentral,you need to exit the KLIA Expres and look for the Komuter entrance within the Sentral complex.) Once at MidValley Komuter station, exit up the stairs and enter MegaMall at First Floor (floor F). Go down to the Ground Floor (floor G) and look for signs to the Boulevard Hotel, or exit North Court and look for the Hotel entrance on your left. The wait for the Komuter train can be long (25 min intervals on the Sunday that I arrived); alternative is to take a taxi from Sentral (for a 5-10 min ride depending on the traffic).Nice and clean hotel & room. Reception staff were respectful enough (not terribly friendly, but not dismissive too). Concierge was helpful in booking of our taxi back to KLIA. Room came with a safe and 2 bottles of free drinking water.If you're a vegetarian like I am, there's a vegetarian stall in the Food Junction food court near the North Court of the mall. Typical Singapore / Malaysian food court vegetarian economy rice stall. Nothing great.

However, the moment the elevator opened onto our floor, we were greeted by a very strong smell of cigarette smoke. We asked the porter whether it was a non smoking floor, he said yes it is. He opened the door to our room and the cigarette smell was even worse! Then we doubled checked again, he still insisted that it was a non-smoking room but offered to spray some fragrance into the room. We refused and said we will ask the reception to see whether we could change room.Then not surprisingly, we found a cigarette tray on the coffee table.We called the front desk to complain as we paid for a king size bed in a non smoking room. We were refused several times, at first saying they were full, then saying that they could shift us to a two single bedded room, and then saidotherwiseyoucanpayextrato upgrade to the next level which is a king deluxe or something. After much discussion, they finally agreed to put us there without an extra charge. The new king deluxe room we got assigned to actually looked exactly the same as the first smoking room, so I don't really know what the big deal was.Overall, we're not impressed with the service and the attitude at all, especially when we compare it to a lot of other hotels around the world with similar standards.

Don't know to smile, communication is poor in receiving and welcoming guest. As if they don't welcome you into the hotel.3) rooms looks old, we stayed in a deluxe room, carpets are old, the tv is 20inch crt (normal tv), not even a lcd, channels are limited. 20 inch Tv is really ancient...something that people used 20 yrs ago. 4) Breakfast is good.5) Lobby and room have PVC sofas!! Very ugly. Mirror on the wall is just rectangle. Not even a frame.

She showed them the confirmation, but they told her it wasn't their fault and she should talk to AA to sort it out. Air Asia proved impossible to get a hold of, so my wife just took her room and completed her stay. On check out they charged her for incidentals on our AMEX, but not for a 2nd room (although during the stay they gave her a key for a second room and made her acknowledge its receipt by signature). My wife just assumed that they had fixed their mistake.Wrong. 3 months later, Blvd went to AA to get reimbursed for 2 rooms, and (low and behold) were told that the booking was only for 1. Instead of just fixing their accounting mistake (a mistake my wife pointed out to them quite clearly), they took the AA payment for 1 room and charged a second room to our AMEX. For 12 days, that was over 4000 MYR. After numerous frustrating calls to BLVD., I gave up and called AMEX. They called BLVD, who finally reversed they illegal charge a couple of weeks later (although at first they were only willing to reduce it). was only due to AMEX's intervention, however.What also came to light was that senior management was put pressure on junior employees to fix the hotel's mistake. The poor girl they put in front of ourselves and AMEX mentioned that staff would have to pay for the room if we didn't.

59200,yeongml,2010-12-28,"Stayed in a studio suite just before christmas day. The hotel is fairly new and the facilities are good. The studio suite is quite roomy. Lighting is a little too dim for my liking and the sofa and other furniture look dated. They belong more to a 3-star hotel than a 4-star one. The bathroom is good and has a great rainshower. But there was no soap! I had to call housekeeping to get some. I suppose it was overlooked by housekeeping staff when they cleaned the room. The small bottle of bath gel is surely inadequate. No major complaints about the room.The executive lounge is big and comfortable. Staff there are friendly and helpful. The evening canapes are nothing to shout about but they are good enough to warm the belly. But one major gripe: Children under 12 are allowed into the lounge! This is a no no, more so when the hotel itself sets the rule that only those above the age of 12 are allowed into the lounge. This rule is on the hotel website as well as on the leaflet that they give out to all guests who stay at the executive floor rooms. But yet the hotel staff themselves do not adhere to it. The hotel management must make up their mind: Keep the rule and enforce it or do away with it if they are unwillilng to be firm with errant guests. It is unfair to those who paid executive prices for executive facilities just to enjoy peace and quiet in the executive lounge but have to suffer because of stubborn and uncooperative guests. The management must be firm on this!My biggest grouse is over the hotel staff. When I arrived, I asked the service desk whether I check in at the ground floor reception or at the executive floor check in. Ground floor, I was told. Later I found out that I could have done it on the 26th floor executive lounge. Would have saved me queuing up. How come I was given the wrong info?Reception staff when checking me in: No greeting, no smile, nothing. Just processed it and that's it. A smile and an 'enjoy your stay' would have been nice.The concierge: When one of the staff handed me my left luggage, I said 'thank you.' No reply, no acknowledgement. That's not good.The ground floor staff, that is, those who greet guests first, lack courtesy and smiles. They look busy all the time and while not directly rude, are abrupt and aloof. My advice to the hotel management: Please get them to smile and interact more with guests.Those in the Wild Rice restaurant are different though. They are friendly, they greet their guests and they thank them. Service is good. The breakfast is satisfying too. A nice touch is the vegetarian corner.Overall, the hotel is not quiet four-star but somewhere between three and four.

At first, hotel staff may seem unfriendly, but a light touch and a bit of harmless humor I find always helps break the ice, then I find the service quite acceptable and flexible. This hotel's parking is a BIG chore. I found out early that the valet parking is reliable. At RM20 a day for guests, it's really quite reasonable, and I got them to park my brand new Mercedes without any hiccups. BTW they call it ""jockey"" service. The Penang restaurant just to the left of the hotel/mall access-way as you enter the mall, is quite good for inexpensive food.As with most 4-star hotels in Malaysia, don't be late for breakfast, otherwise the popular stuff like orange juice is gone!

Location: At the Gardens Mall (and connecting Midvalley Megamall), thus a great place for shopping, especially during the Malaysia Sales weeks. The Hotel is also one train stop from ""downtown"", about 50minutes to KLIA (approx 80Ringitt by Taxi) and about 25 min. from Batu Caves (approx 30Ringitt by Taxi)Conclusion:",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,"Espoo, Finland",Malaysia,"Nice hotel, but Gardens hotel is preferred.",Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:17:27,3,Mid Valley Expressway

Also very easy to get to main KL shopping area if you're brave enough to face KL traffic. Rooms were decent, though could have been more brightly lit. Furnishings are acceptable, but not of top quality, breakfast spread was quite good. Decor is a bit dated, but again, if one is not too fussy, not much to complain about.

Swimming pool and gym acceptable for its price and for short stay. Everything else is not encouraging. We booked 3 rooms but only 1 was ready when arrived and had to keep chasing and escalate to duty manager before the other 2 rooms are ready (took at least 4 hours). No room make-up service and had to chase for 3 hours for that. Staff at reception are very confused - hear a couple also complained for room not being available despite online check-in. Need to be very patient with the staff. Hotel furniture need to be upgraded and bath towers are threadbare. Good for 2 nights stay and only if you get a promotion rate. Reminds me of a airport hotel with no character but largely popular because of its location and price is reasonable.,The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,"Hong Kong, China",Malaysia,"Good location, clean but no service and poor staff efficiency",Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:17:29,3,Mid Valley Expressway
59200,Rikimo,2010-08-04,"I travelled with my hubby and another couple. We just came back from Hilton Sentral (see review). Even though we experienced extremely poor service at Hilton, we all agreed Boulevard Hotel was not comparable to Hilton (partly coz Hilton is 5stars and this hotel is 3.5stars). I wouldn't rate this hotel 4stars as it is lacking a lot of things.1. Try and request for a room NOT facing the North court apartment.. the traffic noise starts from 6.30am everyday..you'll be woken up by honking sound.2. Bed is definitely the same hardness as Thai's bed. My hubby and I didn't have a problem, but if you're use to Aussie bed softness, you might struggle a bit.3. Room amenities are ok. The room seem to be lacking a personal feel.. I put it down to lack of soft touch (flowers, deco).4. Fantastic location if all you want to do it SHOP. Midvalley mall is connected to The Garden mall. It caters to all shopping needs. I personally loved the location, but for the other two men, they didn't. It was very far from everything else so we ended up taking taxi everywhere. The train is not convenient to anywhere else..and its hot and smelly (pack full of sweaty people).5. Staffs in general aren't very approachable. We booked 2 executive room and one of the room was not ready until 3.30pm (even though check-in is 2pm). 6. Executive floor lounge is average. The breakfast is average. I would suggest go down to Wild Rice to have their buffet breakfast instead. And ladies, even though it says the executive lounge offers cocktail, that's incorrect. They only offer beer and usual whiskey selection.. no cocktail or mocktail.Apart from the above 6 points, I would recommend this hotel only to those who are happy to pay no more than RM280NETT/night and want to shop til they drop. If not, you can definitely find a nicer and more comfortable hotel within KL.We're going to try Bukit Bintang area next time as everything is within walking distance.",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,"Perth, Australia",Malaysia,Average hotel with average service.

59200,Mike_Khong,2010-01-17,"Just a quick intro so you are aware of any cultural bias; I am Malaysia-born, but have lived in UK and Australia most of my life. Having read various reviews, I was pleased to find a very nice hotel overall.We rented a car (as I am familiar with the crazy KL traffic) (NB GPS a must) so the first good point was valet parking, the price offset if you get the ticket endorsed at the concierge. Alternative parking was in the shopping mall carpark which was pretty cheap(by our standards), more on this later. Check in was a breeze, staff were very pleasant and efficient. Prebooked additional beds were trundled in soon after we arrived in the rooms, which were connecting as booked. The connecting door was also open (we have occasionally been to hotels where we had to call housekeeping to do this) and everything was very clean. The rooms were adequate in space, while not overly spacious. The six of us found no problems. Only minor gripe was the inadequacy of storage for clothes for all of us (2 adults, 4 children) to unpack fully, and a dry as opposed to a steam iron.Beds were rather firm(!) as noted by another reviewer, but I found them comfortable enough. Some may find the firmness too much if they are used to a softer mattress - be somewhat warned! The bathroom was clean and well maintained. The air-con worked very well and was easy to control.We booked executive rooms - well worth the small extra at the time of booking for the use of the executive lounge for breakfast, and snacks but only till 8 pm. No major meals though. I suspect the main restaurant had a bigger b'fast selection but what we had was adequate. We also had free broadband as part of the package.Service at all times was polite and reasonably efficient.The hotel is situated on top of a shopping mall, one of the larger in KL. From the hotel lobby you can walk through corridor and you are there! It certainly had a very good choice of all the usual shops and anchor stores, including as normal in KL, food courts. These were comprehensive in choice, more expensive than on the street but quality was good, and of course, surroundings were comfortable.Being at the confluence of several major highway routes means easy access to the rest of KL so no hassles there. If you are driving yourself, parking by KL standards is easy as there are several entrances to the mall carpark, pick any, it makes no difference as the lifts take you into the shops and you can walk to the hotel access corridor from anywhere. Otherwise use the valets, as noted before. The carpark is not bad by KL standards, routes inside are well defined (the significance of this statement can only be appreciated by people familiar with Malaysian multilevel carparks!!) and I saw very few jam-ups.Only one other gripe - when we were there the hotel overhauled its hot water system. This resulted in less hot water for about 3 days - enough for me as I don't have it too hot but my wife complained she couldn't have her usual skin reddening temperature! It could have been an issue for some but we never had NO hot water. Just bad luck to be there at that time.Overall I enjoyed my stay and would certainly stay there again, as we and the kids enjoyed easy shopping access, easy food access (we even let them go unaccompanied after a few days) and easy road access to anywhere in KL (traffic jams notwithstanding)!!",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,"Townsville, Australia",Malaysia,"Good position, pleasant rooms, shopping and food at doorstep",Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:17:32,4,Mid Valley Expressway

Mind you, entering KL was bad and we were in the jam for almost 1 1/2 hours but by KL standard, it is nothing to shout about. Upon checking into the room, it was quite smelly...like someone smoked in the room before even we requested for a NON Smoking room. The house keeping on duty came promptly and sprayed some "" odor away "" chemical and the room feels nicer.The rooms are of good size and our king size bed was quite comfortable. We did ask for an additional bed but was told its fully booked. So we asked them to improvised which they did, and lent us a sleeping bag for a young relative who decided to tag along a the last minute.The next day we went to 1 Utama, wifey wanted to check the M&S there and other stuff. Not too bad since the taxi driver did use the meter and took us only 20 minutes top to get to 1Utama Shopping Mall.We like the hotel as there are plenty of food outlets and restaurant around but can be quite pricey.

The kids were devastated there was no children's channel, but they can live without television (just).The staff were lovely, and the convenience of having 2 superb shopping malls beneath the hotel was great. The thing that really let the place down for us were the TERRIBLE beds! I'm used to sleeping on a firm mattress, but these were so hard I woke up everytime I turned over in the night. They were so hard I didn't even want to sit on them to watch TV. Even my young children compained, the only one who was happy was our 4 year-old who was in a foldaway bed. We were going to check out the next day to go elsewhere, but the very helpful staff put an extra comforter (thin duvet) on the mattress to try and ease the brick-like effect. It didn't make much of a difference, but it made it bearable enough for us to grit our teeth and go with it as we only had one night more to stay. We appreciated the gesture,They did ask us the next morning if that had helped and in every other way tried to make sure we were comfortable.We usually stay in the Renaissance, which is fabulous, but thought we'd try somewhere else for a change. The Renaissance has beds with firm mattresses covered with a fabulous thick mattress-protector which has the effect of giving me the comfort of firm, spine-support with the delicious 'aaah' factor I look for when sinking into a perfect sleep.Thanks for trying Boulevard, but we're going to the Renaissance next time.",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,Malaysia,Malaysia,Beds like bricks,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:17:35,2,Mid Valley Expressway

It was useful to b able to get back to the hotel for some rest and quiet before heading out to the mall downstairs for more shopping and eating. Do note that traffic around the hotel seems to be always congested, so it does take a while to leave if u intend to use this hotel as a base to explore KL, not recommended. Getting a taxi from the hotel take ages on weekends.. so be forewarned..all in all, will not hesitate to go back, but will definitely take the club floors.",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,Singapore,Malaysia,Not Bad,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:17:35,4,Mid Valley Expressway
59200,Christine Yf S,2009-08-15,"We stayed for 16 days at the Boulevard Hotel and did we ever regret staying at this place. If the room was not fully paid in advance, we would have moved out of this hotel on our 3rd night stay. The front desk was arrogant and gave us a smoking room with a king bed even though we requested for a non smoking, twin room several months ahead while making the reservation. When we complained, they told us that the hotel was fully booked and that they would move us to a non smoking/twin room the next day. The next day, we were moved to a twin room BUT a smoking one. Once again, they move us and boy, the room that we got this time was in need of a refurbishing. Paints were peeling off and the chair rocks each time we sat on it (my daughter and I are of petite nature), so much so we dare not sit on it. The hotel elevator has a musky smell and the air condition in it was so weak ... lobby was much cooler than the elevator. Breakfast in the coffee shop was horrible. Even though breakfast was included in our rate (the executive rate), we ended having breakfast outside everyday. There's this coffee stand (mamak store) in the mall next to the hotel entrance. They serve the best local breakfast (nasi lemak or soft boil eggs) and it's so much cheaper than eating in the hotel. The KTM train was never on time!! One thing for sure and that is we will be staying somewhere else the next time we visit Kuala Lumpur.",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,toronto,Malaysia,executive club???,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:17:35,1,Mid Valley Expressway

Finally when check in they inform NO KING BED and can arrange to shift on 30 July 09 only.1924 Room was alloted which had no proper lighting, furniture was shabby, paint peeling off, wardrobe full of scratches.

To my horror the sofa was peeling, torn etc. Staff in front desk are very pathetic, lethargic and not customer oriented. They seem to think that if they speak they do a favor to hotel guest.Breakfast was pathetic, looks like they were serving stale/ old food. For sure the food quality was not upto standards. Guys in the bar are friendly and provide good service.Furnishings, carpet, TV etc. in the room are very cheap quality. The facilities provided are not the same as described in internet.

We arrived at 1.30 am and the front desk was perfectly working, with one girl that welcomed us and in 5 minutes we were already in the room, queen bed as requested, high floor as request, although the view from the hotel I don't think is generally amazing. Breakfast was good, of course with local cuisine and continental style (otherwise if you don't like to try why you travel? ;-), served even since early morning; room enough spacious, clean and quite new. Using an internal corridor you are already into the Mid Valley Shopping Mall, which is a plus if you manage to persuade (like I did) your wife to do shopping into it and nowhere else! Prices are good, variety also, unless you want something in particular (like big brands, electronics high end). The same way is linking you with the Kommuter (metro transportation). There is the gym, pool, internet in the rooms. At the front desk people friendly enough, no problems to pay with credit card and for the booking. Of course, if you want to find a downside, you are not in the real center of the city (KLCC), but with 30 MYR max you can go from the KLCC to the hotel via taxi, or even cheaper (but more long of course) with Kommuter.

We did however have real problems with transport. Yes, the hotel was 1 stop from KL Sentral, but we found the train service infrequent, unreliable and on several occasions too crowded to get on. Taxis were not always an easy alternative as the queue is shared with the adjacent shopping mall. My husband was also charged widely varying prices for the same journey to work in metered taxis. If you are staying in KL as a tourist, choose a hotel in the Golden Triangle area.I wrote the above review on the day we were to leave.

If you aren't a local and rely on taxis etc to get around then maybe you would do better around the bukit bintang area. The hotel is connected to Mid Valley which is connected to the higher end The Gardens mall. Mid Valley i would say is in between Selangor and KL so a lot of traffic pass through here. When the traffic is bad - IT IS BAD. The taxis will rip you off or even refuse to drive you back to the hotel unless you are willing to go un-metered. So apart from food and shopping at the 2 malls there isn't much else to do unless you go out. The front desk service is a bit cold. House cleaning did a good job. The toiletries were replaced everyday. Rooms were modern and clean and I have nothing to complain about the size. The bathrooms were marbled and had a very nice and huge shower.

Overall, we are happy with the hotel and would recommend it to anyone wanting a good, spacious, clean place that is not in the city center. In my opinon, being next to a big shopping center is much more convenient and the city center is only a 5-10 minute taxi ride away. It's a standard Malaysian 4 star hotel. Some other reviewers had some unfair complaints, I thought. If you want to pay another USD65, then of course, you can get a 5 -star in KL. The Boulevard is not a 5 star.A lot of people complained about the lifts. They were a tad slow but not to the extent it bothered us. We would stay here again.PROS:-good spacious room (but mind you, we booked the suite)-reasonable breakfast, which we mostly ate in the executive lounge. Breakfast on Level 9 has more selections but for us, breakfast is breakfast. Nice fruit.-friendly staff- executive lounge is great, especially when you need peace and quiet or a nice place to work. Afternoon snacks appreciated.- nice biggish pool and children's pool-nice gym- nice for kids-very central locationCONS:-supposed to get a welcome fruit platter but never received-Internet works strangely and emails sent through the system regularly never get to their destinations, which is a worry.

59200,shario,2009-01-25,"We just got back from three nights at the Boulevard Hotel in Kuala Lumpur and enjoyed our stay very much. We were impressed with how modern and stylish the hotel is. It reminded us of the Majestic Hotel in Bangkok, which we also liked a lot. The breakfast buffet was outstanding, with a lot of Asian and Western dishes. Unlike most of our experiences with Western cuisine in Southeast Asia, the hotel's renditions of European food were pretty good, although they don't use pork products so you get things like beef bacon and chicken sausage. Naturally, the Asian dishes were outstanding.The room was very nice and local calls were surprisingly inexpensive, as opposed to the ripoff prices in the US. The location was okay in that it was attached to a large mall with a lot of interesting shops, such as a fish spa, but in retrospect, I might have preferred to stay somewhere else because it felt kind of weird to be spending so much of our time in Kuala Lumpur in a mall. On the other hand, it was incredibly hot and it was really nice to be in an air conditioned mall, so I have mixed feelings about that. The gym is really nice. We got a massage at the spa which was okay, but a little offputting. I would say that it was our least favorite massage during our trip. It was pretty abrupt for a hotel massage. We were led to the massage room by a guy and then after the massage weren't given any privacy to change our clothes, as the two women just stood there waiting while we dressed. The whole experience was a bit disconcerting, although the massage itself was okay. I would say go to the fish spa at the mall for a massage instead.Everyone we spoke to, including other taxi drivers in Kuala Lumpur, spoke about how awful taxi drivers are in Kuala Lumpur and how they are just waiting to overcharge you, but we didn't have any bad experiences with them, other than listening to them talk about how impossible everything we wanted them to do was, and then actually having them do it and it actually being pretty easy. Not sure what that dynamic was all about. We even hired a taxi driver through the hotel to take us to the Batu Caves and then to the Bird Park for two hours and it was extremely reasonable. I would suggest doing that instead of taking the city tours, which we found pretty frustrating since most of the time was spent picking people up at hotels.",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,"San Francisco, California",Malaysia,Very Stylish Hotel,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:17:38,4,Mid Valley Expressway

It is clearly a 4 star hotel, bright airy lobby, nice rooms that still look new, despite the hotel being a few years old. Check-in was a breeze. The swimming pool was a good size and the gym well-equipped with very friendly staff. We booked through the hotel web-site and got very good deals.

59200,LondonGFtraveller,2008-11-14,"We stayed at the Hotel Boulevard from 1/11 to 5/11 2008. We chose this hotel because of its proximity to the mid valley mega mall. We stayed in a studio suite with access to the executive lounge.Our first impression of the hotel was ok. We were dropped off outside the hotel by our taxi and while there were hotel staff around no one offered to assist us in bringing our cases in to the hotel. I found this particularly annoying in the climate of snatch and grab robberies outside hotels in KL. There was a long queue at check-in, not helped by guests pushing ahead of other guests. As soon as we had checked in a bell boy was able to assist us in taking our cases up to our room and showing us the way. He was also able to program the air con for us on entry. We were welcomed to the room with a gift of 2 huge apples.The studio suite was absolutely brilliant and worth the extra money. We had lots of space, the sheets were clean and the bathroom was also clean and topped up regularly. The executive lounge was really nice, as it has a good panoramic view of the KL skyline. We had breakfast and snacks there everyday and enjoyed the variety of newspapers as well quiet atmosphere compared to the rest of the hotel, which was quite congested at times with school children. The staff at the executive lounge were helpful. The cleaner of our room was a complete star and very kind to me the day that I was unwell.The concierge facilities offered by the hotel are pointless. We asked for information regarding trips to see the fireflies or melacca and were advised to take a bus from the main bus station. The hotel is great for access to the mall, lots of cheap eats, supermarkets to try things, shops and opticians etc. Taxis in to KL were plenty as the main drop off point was outside the hotel. My only gripe about the hotel was that we often had to wait a long time for lifts. Partly as one was being repaired and partly because all lifts serviced all floors rather than a shuttle service to the higher floors.Check out was again uneventful, the event came when we entered the taxi that the hotel insist that we take (the premium rate metered cab). The driver turned out to be new and did not know his way out of mid valley meaning he circled it a few times before we were able to leave. He did however take off the value of the mid valley tour.

The cooked-to-order eggs and omelets are a saving grace. I recommend asking one of the staff to make a fresh coffee for you (the automatic machine coffee is atrocious).For business travel, the mall makes for convenient shopping and has a lot of variety not found in the west.

The corner rooms with lounge area are also very nice, and have a great stand-alone shower with a massive shower head, and good water pressure (something lacking in many hotels).The internet works, and has never let me down yet.The restaurant and bar (Wild Rice Cafe?) are basic but perfectly ok for the breakfast buffet they provide. My only gripes are the Nescafe coffee machines (ask at the bar for a proper coffee) and the orange juice, which is artificial tasting. In this location, you are unlikely to want to eat in the hotel facilities other than for breakfast.The Exec Lounge is nothing special - like all hotel Exec Lounges it's full of vultures circling the canaps like it's a free dinner, and complaining that the plates are too small to load with enough food. If you can afford an Executive room rate, you can afford to eat in restaurants! I won't subject myself to a visit to the lounge again!

59200,StanRos,2008-07-18,"Having stayed there just a few weeks ago my memories of the Boulevard Hotel remain fresh in my mind. Definitely worth it's four star status as I couldn't find a single fault with anything there. What made my four day stay even more memorable was friendliness of the staff who often went out of their way to do things or get things for you.The Mega Mall next door has to be seen to be believed, sheer paradise for the avid shopper although I am not one of those. The food in the restaurant of the hotel was excellent but next door in the mall the choice of eateries and restaurants was maddening. No excuse for going hungry as my now expanded waistline will testify to.The only gripe I did have was that the Boulevard is quite a way from the bustling nightlife of Bukit Bitang, took about ten to fifteen minutes by taxi to get there depending on how fast the driver went. Make sure the driver turns on the meter or haggle a price before getting in or you could find him naming his own.",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,"London, United Kingdom",Malaysia,Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:17:41,4,Mid Valley Expressway
59200,MM2H,2008-07-15,"We chose the Boulevard hotel for a one-night stay because of its convenient location for the Mega-Mall and short drive to KLCC. Previously we had stayed at The Gardens Hotel but decided to give The Boulevard a try this time around. Initially, arriving was a bit of a pain as there was a lot of traffic congestion around the drop-off zone in front of the hotel, which is shared with a taxi stand for the shopping mall. We decided to head straight to parking and carry our bags back as we were travelling light. Parking is a bit of a nightmare as the hotel uses the public shopping mall car parks and these can get very busy indeed. We ended up with a very long walk back through the shopping centre and had to ask for directions to the hotel entrance. I would not want to arrive on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon when the car parks are always packed solid. We arrived an hour before the check-in time but were checked-in quickly and allocated a Deluxe Executive room as booked. When we reached the room though, there was a very noisy mechanical hum coming from somewhere outside of the building. When we looked out of the window we could see that the source was a huge air conditioning plant for the shopping centre several floors down. We listened for a while and decided that there was no way we would sleep with that level of background noise. My husband explained to Reception and they assigned us a new room on the floor below. This room faced in a different direction and was much, much quieter.Despite being new, this hotel has a very gloomy atmosphere, which results from the choice of colour scheme and lighting. The lobby is bright and welcoming but from the lifts onwards the lighting is dim and the colour schemes dark, reminiscent of a cave! The rooms are decorated in very dark colours and although there are plenty of lights the effect is either funeral parlour or interrogation room with nothing much in between. The room was disappointing because it was very cheaply kitted out, especially for Executive level, with wood veneer furniture stained very dark. Already the furniture looks chipped and worn and the carpet had been patched in several places. The bed however was comfortable, with good linens.The bathroom let down the hotel in a very big way. It was cramped with little space to put toiletries or to hang the towels once they were damp. The towels were thin and worn. The plug in the basin was inoperable because the plunger lever had disappeared. There was a long bath and a separate shower stall but neither was very inviting because of a poor level of cleaning. Around the rim of the bath the silicon seal was black with mould  and I mean completely black. The seal around the door to the separate shower was also green/brown from damp and mould, as were the joints between some of the marble tiles. This can only arise from inadequate daily cleaning and at this rate the hotel will quickly deteriorate.Late afternoon there was suddenly a lot of noise from children in the adjoining room. They seemed to be part of a large family group occupying several rooms nearby. Our hearts sank in anticipation of a noisy night. However, when we returned mid-evening it was quiet and there was no more noise until we were woken by their alarm clock at 5.30am! Thankfully the children must have been in another room but avoid a room with an adjoining door if you dont want to hear every noise made by your neighbour or their kids.We sampled the complimentary canaps in the Executive Lounge. The choice was a little on the small side but the snacks were tasty, the staff friendly and the views of the KL skyline and gridlocked traffic below were impressive.After a surprisingly good sleep the experience continued to improve as breakfast was very good. We hadnt expected much but the range of food on offer was huge, kept warm, the quality and tastes were good and the service friendly and efficient. The good thing about this hotel is the location. The downsides are the parking, the cheap furniture, the gloomy rooms and the poorly cleaned bathrooms. Overall, when youre in the room, it isnt a four star experience.Would we stay here again? No. For a little extra cost Id go next door to The Gardens Hotel, which was much better.",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,"Bideford, United Kingdom",Malaysia,Disappointing,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:17:42,2,Mid Valley Expressway
59200,AKurt,2008-07-08,"I had a corner room which was very spacious. Decor was very modern and minimalist which I liked. Bathroom and shower were great. Breakfast was OK, not spectacular. As everyone points out, its right next to a mall. It's also built right on top of an old Hindu temple which was really cool to check out. You also have several restaurants/pubs in walking distance. Overall, I would definitely stay there again.",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,Texas,Malaysia,Good value,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:17:42,4,Mid Valley Expressway
59200,dragonman64,2008-07-07,"I'm teetering between classifying this hotel as a good 3-star hotel or a 4-star wannabe. You see, Boulevard Hotel has its pluses that make for a recommendable stay, but it does have its minuses as well that fall short of personal standards.Let me enumerate the pluses first:- location is excellent if you want to be in the middle of big-sized mall shopping since it is connected to the perenially-crowded Mid-Valley Megamall and just a hop, skip and jump away from the plush Gardens with its high-end shops and ambience. With this said, dining options are numerous.- the rooms are of a decent size with high ceilings and a strong-pressured rainshower feature in the equally decent-sized toilet and bath.- really spacious breakfast area in the 9th floor with al-fresco options for those who want to eat in the open.- attentive hotel personnel who look out for your needs and/or complaints with expediency.- complimentary daily morning newspaper and two bottles of mineral water.Now, let's go to the debit side:- while location is good for the serious shopper, first-time tourists will most likely negotiate some serious degree of traffic (especially on weekends) in the area if they want to go to other parts of KL. There is a commuter that can take you to KL Sentral in a jiffy, but you will need to make transfers from there to go to places like Bukit Bintang, KLCC or KL Tower. Yes, taxicabs are plenty, but then again, the traffic from 9am to 8pm can be annoying.- buffet breakfast leave much to be desired for eaters who prefer western-style food. But options for local fare are abundant.- pool area is adequate, but was not properly-supervised or maintained (at least during my stay.) Kids should always be in the company of parents or guardians.- lobby area can be cold and impersonal - and this is one of the dead giveaways making it more of a 3-star property.In summary, staying at Boulevard Hotel is not bad, but paying more than USD100 for your room is a bit much because the nearby Cititel Hotel Mid-Valley can practically match what they offer at a cheaper price. This is a basically a 3-star place in the guise of a 4-star hotel.",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,"Manila, Philippines",Malaysia,A good base for the serious mall shopper,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:17:42,3,Mid Valley Expressway
59200,LizzyHo,2008-06-20,"It was our family's 1st drive up to KL and it was pretty easy getting to the hotel. We booked the executive deluxe king room with an extra bed and it was still quite spacious for my 2 kids to play around. The hotel's website gives the best rate.Our room was on the top floor & access to the floor was only through the room card key in the lift. There's quite a spread for breakfast at the restaurant but nothing too fantastic. Breakfast is also served on the executive lounge but a smaller spread, which serves us well enough. We also preferred to eat there as it is less crowded & we get a good view of KL tower & the Twin Towers.The mall is just next to the hotel and there's even a children's playground on the top floor. They also offer child drop-off service, so parents can have a peace of mind shopping while kids had their fun.On the whole, we love the hotel & its convenience.

59200,fairiesclub,2008-06-14,"We drove up to KL recently and wanted to stay at a place where it is just at the fringe of the city with low traffic flow and offers a good shopping experience. Boulevard Hotel KL has exactly all that. This hotel is good for people who love shopping. The new kid on the block is Robinsons. There are also a wide selection of restaurant and cafe. I am very fussy when it comes to hotel room and beddings. Well, Boulevard did not disappoint me. We were given a king size bed, covered in white bedsheets. Smell really clean. The room is also free from mouldy-smell. It also has enough space for an extra bed. The toilet has a bathtub and a separate standing shower. The flushing system is also not noisy. Although it is part of the Mid Valley Mall, security is adequate. Breakfast spread is average. My 2 young girls had fun playing in the swimming pool but complained of strong chlorine smell. Gym is very well equiped too. Do prepared to pay $10/day for valet parking though. The hotel does not provide free parking for its guests.

However, as a plus (and a minus), it is connected to the Mid-Valley MegaMall and although very convenient, at times I felt as if I was living in the Mall.The room was comfortable and clean. The front desk staff was business-like. The bell staff was excellent. Helpful and informative. Overall a good experience. However, although very acceptable, I don't think it is quite a 4 star hotel.

59200,perryw,2008-02-18,"I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in February because it was close to the MidValley Megamall.I think this hotel is good in terms of value for money because everything about it was quite good and it certainly deserves its four star tag.Firstly, the reception is professional and knows what it's doing and what it's talking about.The rooms were of a good size, I stayed in the superior rooms. The furniture was of a good quality including the tv, some of the furniture though did have some scratches and was a little worn on the edges. Also, when I got here I found the mini safe in the room locked and I think this shouldn't happen because the staff should check up on these sort of things, maybe that's what makes this a four star hotel instead of five.The bed was extremely clean and comfortable, good to sleep all day with the total blockout curtains. The only problem is the thermostat seems to only have hot or cold temperatures because once I hear the click on turning the dial, it means it either changed from hot to cold or the other way round. So, it's a bit misleading to have all the temps on the dial.The bathroom was large and the shower was a rainshower so that was good.

59200,Tiramits,2008-02-16,"We stayed at the Boulevard Hotel in August of 2007 for around 3 weeks - 4 adults and a young child. We did not realize then that it was situated inside the mid-valley megamall. We give this location a straight 5 stars because of LOCATION!... great view from the room; right inside the mall with a special entrance to the mall - so terrific shopping and for lunch and dinner, we could go to the food court in a few minutes and enjoy! My young son loved to walk around the mall and the shopping here is certainly comparable to the best in the world. Hotel staff were very responsive and accommodating of our requests. We found 2 small cockroaches in the bathroom but staff quickly sprayed the place thoroughly. Breakfast was luxurious with a wide choice of items. Mega-mall is well connected to other parts of KL by bus and by the sub-way. So, absolutely no difficulty in traveling anywhere and we felt safe all through. I would definitely re-visit here with my family; the mall is just terrific! Enjoy...! One tip: it has been widely advertised to use the intra-city KL express from the airport to the city; the best way alternatively is to travel by taxi (same price and time; but less hassles since it is a straight drop from airport to the hotel instead of catching a taxi again at the station).We booked through Asiarooms.com and thought we got a really good deal (around $ 70 / double room with bf included).",The Boulevard-St Giles Premier Hotel,toronto,Malaysia,Will definitely re-visit and stay here!,Kuala Lumpur,2016/10/08 22:17:44,5,Mid Valley Expressway
59200,bsy,2008-02-12,"This was my second trip in as many years to the hotel. I stayed for 12 days and had a suite and an adjoining room for my kids. The room was pretty much well maintained and comfortable but a little the worse for wear; for example, the bathroom blinds were in need of replacement and the shower stall leaked. Annoyingly, and somewhat bafflingly, the hotel (still) has no clocks in the rooms. Housekeeping was pleasant but less than outstanding - over the course of my stay 3 of my kids' bed toys went missing and I had to call to retrieve them. Also, reception and the operator are pretty patchy and phone calls both from within and without the hotel were frequently left unanswered. Finally, all iPhone owners be warned that although broadband Internet access is available for free in the rooms with a cable, wifi has to be obtained via a 24 hour card which, although free, has to be obtained from the reception on a daily basis which can be tricky as this requires explanation to a new person everyday (if someone picks up the phone, that is). Having said all that, these are relatively minor grouses and you get what you pay for. This is a nice hotel, well located, with good facilities, reasonable pricing, and for the most part, a warm and friendly staff.

This hotel is not directly in KL city centre and is therefore priced much cheaper than the equivalent in the Petronas Tower area.
