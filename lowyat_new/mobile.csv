This will be a mostly bad review as my experience within 72 hours wasn't quite good with it... Was heartbroken I'd paid RM 3299 of my own savings yet getting so much problems regarding this laptop hybrid. The unit I got was Acer Switch Alpha 12 SA5-271-571N – 12 IPS QHD Touch / I5-6200U / 8GB / 256GB SSD / W10 by my cousin who was the dealer. The Acer Switch Alpha 12 at first was a great laptop by glance, everything is included with the SRP pricing of RM 3499. You thought it will be a great Surface Pro replacement but it is not. And here is why. It is easily prone to dents and scratches, so do not try to put the laptop and charger on the same or nearby bag compartment especially you travel in public transport like trains where you will squashed to a corner. The stylus isn't really accurate for writing, or drawing. Due to weak inking function from both windows and Synaptics drivers. My pen died on the 3rd day after I'd got it, it suddenly stopped working, overheating and died after 2 hours of use. It is quite sad, it is now in Acer Warranty... The laptop has a bad input digitizer display. I've been facing these problems all day... after I send in my stylus for repair, thinking it was just only the problem from the screen. The bad, no Adapters for the USB 3.1C Type C port given by Acer. I bought a Genuine XiaoMi USB 3.1C Type C adapter and OTG cable, yet it doesn't have enough current to power my USB. Not sure is this a faulty unit or I fried the port myself. Camera, both of camera are equally bad, grainy I don't think people should hold tablets to take photos. and they should never will. Unless your 5MP camera is great as Apple's iPads... These are the issues I faced these following few days through daily blog: I reached out to both Acer Malaysia and its website Support team. Both qave bad response.... regarding its services."|4027805|A faulty unit review.|iSean|81232365|iSean|244|0|Acer Switch Alpha 12 Quick Review.|2016-08-12T21:11:00
